TITLE,DATE,RATING,REVIEW
Find something better.not worth the price,Date of stay: September 2022,10,"The hotel location is good, but rooms are small, maybe that's how it is in Singapore. But the hotel service is pathetic. They have just one luggage trolley which the guests have to pull to the room and bring back to the lobby.No service there. The room service is also slow and mostly do not understand basic courtesy especially if travelling with small kids. Further, the worst is the breakfast- the menu is 90percent non vegetarian and does not cater to international standards- for eg they wont serve an omelette, or wont give warm milk for small kids. No tea or coffee. The food preparation, even in case of non veg is pathetic. And breakfast is served in disposable plates. The worst part is, that they remove the buffet strictly at 10am and wont offer even a cup of coffee or bread strictly at 10.00am. Not only this, they switch off the lights at the cafe area even if guests are sitting and guests are told to wrap up in the next two minutes. We were traveling with small kids and it felt as if we were not on vacation but in a hostel mess. A very bad experience at the hotel"
Lousy. Not worth the price,Date of stay: August 2022,10,Very unprofessional. Bounced reservations later accepted. Room was dingy and shabby. Bathroom was like a public washroom with no toiletries. See pic for tea coffee tray. Surprised how come such hotels are allowed to operate in Singapore.
You can find better place,Date of stay: August 2022,30,"Basic, Budget, Tour Group Hotel,……..depend on your definition. Many facilities should be immediately renovated after Covid 19. If not, customer may not revisit.  We have party of 6 as booking 3 rooms. Only one and only good thing is location. Some issues have been ignored as there were few hotel staff returning to work such as housekeeper.  Since it is tour group hotel, - Wrong morning call at 6 30 am on 2nd day - Wrong door knocking at 10:30 pm on 2nd night - Wrong door knocking at 00.45 am on 3rd night  Can you imagine how I felt about this hotel?  For me, revisit will be not my expectation.  If you have limited budget and love Orchard area, please go ahead………  Staff at lobby are very ok….. friendly and helpful"
Good location,Date of stay: June 2022,30,"The hotel's location is very central on Orchid Road, close to bus stop and Malls. The hotel room was comfortable and being on the 8th floor had a panoramic view over the trees. I spent 2 nights there and the room was not serviced. Breakfast was included, however, polystyrene plates and plastic cutlery!! That was a shock. The breakfast was simple, not a great selection. This was post Covid-19. The WiFi in my room was not connecting, great fully, a technician was sent up and it was sorted out. I would stay there again due to the location."
The lowest of the low - avoid unless desperate,Date of stay: June 2022,20,"Extremely run down and low end hotel that is in desperate need of an upgrade. I'd liken it more to a hostel than a hotel. Hallways had mouldy ceilings, showers had only half curtains so water spilled all over the floor and the rooms were dark and lacking natural light. They had the audacity to charge for storing baggage, and the breakfast was one of the worst I've experienced. Plastic plates and cutlery, poorly prepared and low quality food - it felt like being at a soup kitchen. They cannot claim it's due to COVID as all other hotels in Singapore have resumed normal buffet breakfast with proper plates and cutlery.  Terrible!"
Nightmare Hotel - Worst Experience Ever,Date of stay: June 2022,10,"Full of guest garbage in the hallway, the housekeeping simply doesn't show up, once you asked for cleaning the room, they just give two new towels.  TV remote doesn't work, the fridge doesn't work. Got sick on the second day of stay. What a bad experience for 4-star price, avoid this hotel and just pay more to go somewhere else."
1/2 star service in a 4 Star Hotel,Date of stay: June 2022,10,"This is one of the worst ever so called 4 Star hotel that I have ever stayed in, I will give 1 to 2 stars the most. Check-in was slow and inaccurate. No room make up service provided and even after being reminded twice. No duty manager on site available to take care of guests grievances or complaints. Please down grade this hotel to 1 or 2 Star."
Best hotel in Singapore!,Date of stay: August 2021,40,"We have visited in August, 2019.  Small rooms but neat and tidy.  Depending on what you need as a traveler, if you want to just have a clean bed and relax 5-6 hours, this is the place.  Hotel Chancellor provides basic necessity.  I would really like to visit this place once again!"
1st world country but 3rd world WiFi internet provided,Date of stay: April 2021,10,"Room is small and a bit dusty I’m ok for it... But I ready can’t acceptable is very very poor WiFi provided, have to use my own Mobil data until over usage!!!! Hello I’m staying here is 14days is not 1 or 2 days. Feedback and highlight several time also no use until I disappoint."
Early Days of Pandemic,Date of stay: February 2020,30,"We visited Singapore in early February 2020, in the early days of pandemic. In the afternoon we arrived Singapore declared orange status which meant getting uncontrolled & difficult to trace.  The airport was pretty cautious, yet not many people wearing masks. Chancellor Hotel complied to the rules they should register each guests historical travel: date & number of flight, seat number, last departure city, etc. Very good indeed.  The hotel itself is quite old. I believe it was very famous in the 80s-90s, observing its facility and strategic location (very close to Plaza Singapura). However many modern hotels in the same league were established in Singapore. So I guess not many foreigners chose this hotel, except for tourists who usually arrive with chartered buses.  Anyway, the room was nice. The facility was working. Although as I said: almost all furnitures are quite old (bathroom, drawer, cabinet, door). But if you don’t mind all these, Chancellor is among the best in Orchard Road & very close to Dhoby Gout MRT station."
Average,Date of stay: May 2019,40,"Room was ok, it was clean. But the breakfast i think they need to improve on it. Not much choices and the variety of food is really not that appetizing. So i stayed for one night, then transfer to another hotel (to try too)."
A total let down,Date of stay: March 2020,10,"We had an event nearby the hotel the next day hence we booked 4 rooms via OTA. Upon check in, FO asked if I just made the bookings as he could not find my bookings. Told him to check under the specific names. Check in took over 45mins for 4 rooms.  - rang the One Service number to request for 2 pairs of bedroom slippers at 5pm. They NEVER arrived... The female operator on the other line sound uninterested and reolied that she will have to check with housekeeping (forever?)  - shower stall overflows and wet the toilet area during shower  - nothing was mentioned about the pool closure, be it on OTA websites or upon check in. Such a let down when we were supposee to be on staycation  - staff in general are the ""legends"" who may have been in the hotel for ages  - no BASIC items provided in the room: no coffee/tea satchet, no disposable toothbrush, bedroom slippers  To sum it off, NEVER stay in this hotel if you are looking for service or used to full serviced hotels."
WORST HOTEL,Date of stay: March 2020,10,"The only positive thing about this hotel was the location.  Room and cleanliness meets the basic needs. The service was nowhere higher than average. I noticed that the staff at the reception were not even proactive enough to help me store my luggage and insisted on me waiting for the bellman/security who was then talking to another guest. After lingering around for a few minutes, she was then willing to assist me.  The worst was the breakfast. I understand that it is the Covid-19 season and that hotels are cutting costs but their breakfast spread is just depressing. The worst was that there were birds at the breakfast area. As the breakfast area was beside a garden, there were sparrows flying and can you imagine what kind of contamination it can bring?  After the breakfast on the first night, I told the reception about this but birds were still flying around at the breakfast area. Pictures below for proof.  As a hotelier myself, I will never stay here ever again and would not recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a proper stay.  The management needs serious help."
It was alright,Date of stay: December 2019,50,"They said, every price selling cost measures its quality and services. Depending on what you need as a traveller, if you want to just have a clean bed and set aside 1 or 2 hours to chill by the swimming pool, this is the place. If you want to find a fancy place, then you have to match your budget with the proper needs you deserve. To me, Hotel Chancellor provides basic necessity. Don't set too high hopes if your budget is just mediocal. My stay was alright, but I think the frontliners need to smile more, and management has to work on the image dull-looking lobby. High ceiling is nice, just these two aspects and am sure will have more repeat happy guests."
Hotel in dire need of refurbishment,Date of stay: February 2020,20,"Stayed here because of price and location close to Orchard Road. Hotel lobby area is reflective of the property generally. Very outdated and in dire need of an upgrade. My room was clean but the bed was not comfortable, whilst the TV channels were simply appalling, with no decent international news channel. Rooms are also long-overdue for a refurbishment to bring them into the 21st century. Would not stay here again as it was such a poor experience.Only positive was good, free internet connection."
Worth It,Date of stay: February 2020,50,"Great location - close to train stations, bus stops within walking distance. Plenty of nearby malls. For not so expensive tasty meals Lucky Plaza is the go-to place  Friendly, efficient staff - housekeeping team was helpful. Checked in on our needs daily. Restaurant staff were very accommodating. Helped us to store ice cream since fridge inside the room wasn't meant for chilling  Room & Amenities - as expected of most Singapore hotels. Slightly smaller room but adequate space for 2 adults. Sunset at rooftop pool was quite enjoyable.  In summary, we had a pleasant stay. Felt what we paid justify the values we got in return"
Not as expected,Date of stay: February 2020,20,"I’d like to be positive because the staff were friendly, the rooms clean and the towels super soft but........ The advertised restaurant in the evening was closed, the breakfast meagre and the pool a disaster. The photograph online didn’t look too bad but the noise from the air conditioning units on the roof was horrendous and it never seemed to stop. Not somewhere for a relaxing stay. Our room and bathroom were very small. We moved after the first night....."
Honestly terrible,Date of stay: January 2020,10,"When I was booking a room, I specifically booked a room with one big bed. In the check-in line, there were two people in front of me, and the front desk asked if they wanted a big bed or two small beds, and they said, “Ummmm... maybe a big bed is fine.” When it was my turn - and I was literally RIGHT BEHIND THEM - the front desk told me they were out of rooms with big beds, and we could only get a room with two single beds. When I showed her my booking, she said, “Sorry, the hotel is full. That is the only room we have left.” WHAT?! That is ridiculous!  When I questioned further, she said, “Check-in time is at 3pm, so all the rooms are gone. You should have come earlier.” The people in front of me LITERALLY got a room with a big bed, when they didn’t request it. Also, is it my fault that my flight landed at night?!  I am honestly baffled and appalled by this ridiculous service! Honestly if they had been kinder about it, and perhaps tried to find a solution (which, at the price I’m paying, I would DEFINITELY expect), I would not be this angry. However, the fact that she even turned it around and said it was my fault just made me even more mad!  The rooms are old and cramped as well, and there are hardly any amenities. It was in a pretty seedy location as well, which I didn’t expect.  Terrible customer service, and definitely terrible quality considering how expensive it is!"
Excellent tour desk at this Hotel,Date of stay: January 2020,50,"The hotel's accommodation is standard as you would expect of a 3 star rating. It's comfortable and have the essentials we needed. I do like their initiative to drive a more greener and sustainable offering with the filtered water system rather than bottled water and soap dispenser in the room. The bed was comfortable, not too soft or lumpy.  What I was most impress with was the Tour desk service available at this hotel. Susan Hoo and her team were AMAZING!!! We traveled in a family of 10 with young and elderly members and Susan was so helpful in providing advice and recommendations and put together an awesome 4 day itinerary for us that worked with our pace. We felt we were able to cover all the key attractions and was able to travel in comfort at an affordable price and excellent service. I would highly recommended the tour desk service at this hotel!"
Busy tucked away hotel,Date of stay: January 2020,40,Extremely busy hotel. Tucked away off Orchard Road. Staff very friendly and helpful. Room surprisingly comfortable. Would opt for room on higher floors 8 and above then you get a great view. Hotel breakfast was adequate and clean. Housekeeping good.
Nice,Date of stay: January 2020,50,"It was very nice 3 night's stay at Chancellor hote Singapore Good breakfast clean room, nice view from the Room,the swimming pool on top of the building. I will recommend for sure.the hotel was so busy when we're their but no problems."
Good for business or family trip,Date of stay: January 2020,40,"Great location and enaugh room space for business trip or family trip, kindly staff and fast respons if you have any problem. If you are a moeslem, no halal sertificate for restorant on this hotel. Worth it with your cost"
"Clean, Tidy and Beautiful Singapore",Date of stay: December 2019,40,"Myself and four other family members stayed five days (26th Dec to 30th Dec 2019) at Chancellor Hotel in Singapore. Dhoby Ghaut MRT station is about 10 min.walking distance from the hotel. Orchard road is very close with so many shopping malls to do your shopping. There are lot of eating places close to the hotel. Because of the excellent public transport system you can get to any place you like withing a very short time and in comfort. But be prepared to walk a lot, even withing the MRT stations. Take comfortable walking shoes. Singapore is generally hot and humid throughout the year. Taxis are also a plenty and not very expensive. Since my last visit to Singapore I found that cost of living has gone up. The hotel was very good with clean comfortable rooms, and with good a/c. We stayed on B/B basis, so I can comment only about the breakfast. Breakfast was not very great- with few options. Staff were very polite and helpful. There is a pool on the top floor.There is a money changer in the lobby area , but the rate is a little low. We enjoyed our stay at the hotel."
Heading home,Date of stay: December 2019,50,We had been at a wedding in Vietnam and decided to visit Singapore on our way home we stayed at this hotel it is in a really great spot for all your shopping the rooms are nice and clean and includes breakfast in the price it is cheaper priced hotel but the postion of the hotel is fantastic would definitely stay here again.
Not Impressed at All,Date of stay: December 2019,20,Woken by a phone call from reception at 7.45hrs after flight from the UK previous day. Reception staff denied. Stopped publicly from having breakfast by an intrusive female member of staff stating we have not included breakfast in our stay. Finally sorted after going back to room and fetching and showing our written confirmation documents. No apologies from the intrusive female but a very apologetic food and beverage manager. Disappointed.
Average,Date of stay: December 2019,30,We spent 2 nights here for a short trip to meet some people. Never stay here before ever. The room is quite small but clean. The staffs are very friendly. Everything in the rooms works nicely.  There are only 2 things they can upgrade. Number one is the bed. It is very hard bed. Like we are sleeping on a plank. Secondly the breakfast was below average. They must improve.
Worst service ever,Date of stay: December 2019,10,"Average room quality but worst service ever. You have to put the light on for room cleaning service. We did so but noone came. And even when we called front dest at 10pm, answered after 10 mins and said “you have to call tommorrow, so we will manage house keeping for you”. I didn’t pay 150$ to receive this service!!!"
Convenient Location,Date of stay: December 2019,30,"We stayed here for two nights in a triple deluxe room. The room was ok, big enough for three people. Bathroom amenities were provided. Roof top pool was nice.  Location was good, near MRT Somerset and within walking distance to Orchard Road.  Check in was quick and efficient, Mr Lee, the FOM, was attentive. Thank you!"
Nightmare !,Date of stay: November 2019,10,"Rude staff to begin with especially Jenny from the room reservation team . Next came on November 16 morning at 8am , the Housekeeping , her name was mentioned as Dean, she kept ringing the door bell and we were sleeping . She came again this time calling out hello hello and then used her card and opened the room door and both of us panicked. We were leaving our room about 12 plus to 1pm for our lunch ( as we didn’t book the room with breakfast as we know we will skip breakfast ) she was complaining saying that she has been waiting and had to finish cleaning the room and I asked her if that’s the case if we have to follow her schedule she said yes . I am truly amazed with the kind of attitude the hotel has and the way they are trained . As a local singaporean I couldn’t appreciate this attitude I wonder how the other tourist be treated . I strongly urge travellers with service expectation to avoid this hotel . Nightmare experience . Anyway thank you Mr Wilson for accommodating my early check in at 12pm ."
You pay for what you get,Date of stay: November 2019,30,Cheap stopover sold as part of the Singapore airlines package. So I paid little and was not disappointed. Location is central and convenient. Rooms are basic and tired. Reception not very friendly. I agreed a later checkout but then got continued calls to check out. Maybe a miscommunication.
Worst Hotel in Singapore,Date of stay: November 2019,10,"Absolutely ridiculous hotel. Stinky, poor behaviour of staff, ridiculous breakfast. Racist and absolutely a waste of everything. Front office manager John was the most ridiculous hotel employee I have ever met. Zero professionalism and no courtesy whatsoever. Never book this hotel. Absolutely a disgrace."
Location..,Date of stay: November 2019,30,"Checkin was a nightmare, poorly organized.  The rooms are basic, but clean with good bed and shower.  Basic breakfast but all you need.  The location of the hotel is prime, the hotel is really competative priced.  If you should stay here or not is up to budget. Price quality is okay"
Review,Date of stay: November 2019,10,"Pros: -Good location.  Cons: -please renovate your rooms.(carpet is old and smelly, the shower head is rusty) - the breakfast selection is just unacceptable.I guess the management already knows.Never book a room with breakfast please! Eat somewhere else or order Grabfood!! -a little motivation and hospitality of some of the Front Desk people will be appreciated. To remind you people, you are the heart of the hotel.Genuine smile and hospitality is a must!  Book somewhere else if you don’t wanna spoil your mood."
Terrible hospitality,Date of stay: November 2019,10,I stayed here for 1 night on 2nd november till 3rd 2019 for 2 rooms. Cons 1. Hotel do not provide utensils in room 2. Hotel do not provide toiletries 3. Hotel has tea maker but u can drink tea once in a trip u cannot ask for another else they will charge 4. In breakfast u cannot order omllette it is again chargeable and there is no food for indian as they have only chinese chef and they will not even help u with hot and cold milk as again it is chargeable Nobody will belive this is Internatinal hotel since hospitality is so terrible they just want extra money for even water Terrible experience Raghav bansal +91 9999974824 Room#523 and 660
No response,Date of stay: November 2019,10,"We are traveling with 2 young kids and are yet to check in, and have sent multiple mails for confirming baby cot availability etc. There is just no response from the hotel ! Dreading our stay already."
Only location is good..,Date of stay: October 2019,10,"Room smells old. Lousy breakfast. Bathroom too small. Amenities like the room slippers very thin like paper. Housekeeping not 24 hours. Deposit for incidentals must be in cash of SGD50. If credit card, after 14 days will be credit back. Not coming back in this hotel."
Terrible experience,Date of stay: October 2019,10,"I went to ITB ASIA tourism show and book a room at Hotel Chancellor@Orchard, no body help me take my luggage. The bathroom is terrible smell. Lobby is always noisy. I event can hear my next room talking. I ask for a double bed but they gave me a twin bed without explanation. When check out, I ask for a Concierge to help me bring my luggage, nobody take the phone. The housekeeper told me that it's not his job, and I only call number 1 for help. I try again and still nobody help. I can't believe that is a 4 star hotel"
Avoid this useless hotel,Date of stay: October 2019,10,"This is a hotel which should b avoided at all cost  Cons : Breakfast- if u can eat only bread butter in veg food and French fries daily...pathetic food in nonveg add eggs dat to not boiled properly.  Smelly lobby carpet- Bad smell  Bed not comfortable and small rooms  No toiletries in bathroom  Noisy swimming pool- AC ducts installed there which wil not allow u to sit for even 2minutes it's too noisy.  Rude receptionist  Pros - Free wifi  Overall poor experience, avoid at all cost...pathetic breakfast poor upkeep"
Outstanding service,Date of stay: October 2019,50,"Another wonderful Stay at chancellor orchard! During the time I checked in the the lobby was messy with lots of indian tourists and i unable to get into the lift as they push me to the back. Thank you to Mr warren that happen to be there, he bring me to the backdoor lift and accompany to my floor level. I felt very homely at that moment. He is Very Flexible and the stay really worth for the value for his service. I like to thank him walking an extra mile to make my stay convenient and enjoyable."
Never again,Date of stay: September 2019,10,"I was disappointed because it was an extreme budget hotel where breakfast looked like something from a horror movie. It was frightening, it felt like I had gone to the wrong place. Three star should be better especially is a modern country such as Singapore.  I would never go there again. It was booked for me and my lesson learnt is to check and read reviews. I made assumptions and suffered for it.  The hotel foyer has a little kiosk much like what you see at the train station. Shocking really"
Worst Hotel Experience,Date of stay: October 2019,10,"I just started my stay today and immediately I have so many complaints. The carpet looks like it hasnt been cleaned for a long while. The paint needs changes and the hotel smells old, even the lobby looks shady. Worst part is that the wifi is not working in my room since I was placed towards the end of the hallway. If you move closer to the lifts then wifi signal gets stronger. I asked customer service on what they can do, their reply was ""it is how wifi works, what can we do?"". So I went downstairs to talk to the front desk receptionists and complained, wanting to move to a room near the lifts so that I can get better reception since I need the connection for work and all they could say was: ""you can complain and request for transfer tomorrow morning when you talk to my colleague"". The room and how it looked was already a bit unbearable, the price kind of justifies the premium on price, but with this type of service I will never book this place again in the future. Not a big loss for them but hopefully would shed light to future travellers that are looking at this hotel. Trip advisor can only rate from 1 - 5 stars, true rating I have for this is 0 stars, no redeeming feature whatsoever please do not book if you are here for business trip or if you need good wifi or service."
Short holiday in Singapore,Date of stay: October 2019,40,This hotel is in a great locatoon. Somerset tube station and fantastic shopping areas 300 yards away. Close by is a selection of hawker stalls selling lovely food and of course Tiger Beer. Taxis are always available at the hotel foyer. The hotel itself has a large reception with friendly staff. Our room was immaculate and the maid cleaned it and changed bedding everyday. Nice rooftop pool with great views 360°. Would definitely come back.
Best hotel!,Date of stay: August 2019,50,"I love this hotel so much! Especially, their rooftop swimming pool! You can see the view of Orchard, the bustling shopping district! Also, near the hotel you can find the best eating place to have breakfast, lunch, dinner and you name it all. It's a 24hrs food joint! Everything is walking distance!"
Nice hotel in an Amazing location,Date of stay: September 2019,50,"i totally had a positive experience at this place, booked this hotel through an agent from India based on their recommendations. on arrival had to pay $50 SGD as a deposit money which was refunded totally on exit. very polite and enthusiastic staff.  located besides to the world famous road of Orchard, Singapore. very close proximity to many shopping centers, restaurants, clubs and eateries."
Disappointing,Date of stay: September 2019,20,"On arrival we were immediately disappointed. Entrance foyer was bustling with people and very noisy. Not very welcoming or inviting. We could hardly hear what receptionist said to us but check-in was quick. Room ok. We had breakfast package but wished we hadn't. We stayed four nights. The breakfast room (don't feel it deserves the title,dining room) was awful. Scruffy and overcrowded. Not enough serving spoons etc. and we witnessed one guest helping herself to chips with her hand. There was little or no supervision. Toaster toasted on one side of the bread only so queue very long. Often bread ran out, as did pastries. I ate only watermelon. Hot drinks were limited to black coffee or black tea with the option of adding powdered milk. We accept that this is a budget hotel but a decent breakfast away from the hotel can be purchased cheaply and we felt that this hotel should look to improve what it offers and improves the standards in both presentation, quality and hygiene and using the argument that it is a budget hotel is a poor excuse for what we experienced at breakfast. A hand sanitiser at the entrance would go a long way to improve the situation. Limited unattractive seating in the foyer which meant we had to stand for much of the time whilst waiting for our taxi pick-up. Although the location is good we will not be using this hotel again and cannot recommend it."
Underwhelming hotel,Date of stay: September 2019,20,"We stayed at the Chancellor Hotel on our return journey from Italy you australia to “break” the trip. The foyer is austere, noisy and not very welcoming. The service staff at front desk were ok - just. The room was modest with scintillating views over the commercial rooftops of other buildings. The “restaurant” was more like an austere University’s cafe - not terribly welcoming or comfortable. There is no bar, or lounge in which one can sit and the foyer has a couple of rows of chairs back to back where people wait. The swimming pool on the roof is quite attractive at about 20m long but no bar or cafe adjacent. If you are looking for a modest overnight stop then it’s probably ok but for anything more, I would look elsewhere."
Great location,Date of stay: September 2019,50,A short stay from 15-19 Sep for business trip. room is nice but should provide free water 2 bottle a day. Great location 5 mins walk distance to Orchard road shopping center and so many restaurant a long the road. Staff was nice and friendly. Fast check in and check out.  Overall is great. Highly recommended Will be back
"Boutique hotel in a nice and convenient location, BUT inhuman and degrading treatment of customers",Date of stay: September 2019,30,"Stayed in this Hotel in the second week of September. The rooms and the corridors need freshening up with new coat of paint and carpet change, or carpet shampooing. The worst experience was the overcrowded breakfast area, which lacked service staff, lack of supervision of the dining area.This resulted in empty food dishes, tables cluttered with dirty dishes, and birds from outside flying in to the dining area and picking food at the tables. At the same time there's an adjoining dining area where selected few were having breakfast."
One night stay,Date of stay: April 2019,30,"I stayed in this hotel with my friends. Didnt take the breakfast package and prefer to find breakfast around the hotel. The location is close to sommerset mrt. Service is fine, no bad experiences as other people mention. The room is enough if you weren’t staying with kids and planning to stay for a short time. The bathroom was ok although there were no soundproofing.. :))"
Not return the forgotten thing,Date of stay: August 2019,10,"We were at Chancellor hotel at night 21/08/2019 in room N329. I forgot a dress, that was hanging in the closet. I notified my tour guide about that and he contacted with the hotel. 2 week has passed I have not received any response from Chancellor hotel.I sent email about this problem, nobody responsed my email. I wrote question on Google web, no answer.How I should understand this attitude and the quality of hotel services. Maybe the manager put this form to display"
Group Reservation Turned Ugly Experience,Date of stay: September 2019,10,"I am currently staying in the Hotel Among my fellow 100 Indian Passengers. This hotel is the worst hotel I have seen, No amenities in Room like Tea coffee make, comb, shaving kit or dental kit. Breakfast is only Chinese oriented and when asked to arrange Two Indian Dishes they said they can't, not even for a group, Only Star it is getting because of Wonderful check in assistance given by Mr. Satish from Group Check in Help desk. If you are willing to take a chance to experience Horrible excuse on the name of Hotel Industry just come in. Specially they are treating Indians like they are slum dwellers. I mean a smile or courtesy face is good enough but instead we see stone cold faces.  Me and my tour leader was 2 person in one twin room, when we reached at Room in Evening we found only one bath towel, we requested to Operator for Secons Towel and to my surprise they said their house keeping is close and they can not provide the Towel. After lots of To and fro along with duty Manager They said they will provide one Towel but We have to come down to front desk to collect it.  Oh My God what kind of Business they are running ???  They are Ruining the name of Singapore  I will change the review if I see something positive tomorrow"
Ageing,Date of stay: August 2019,30,"The checkin process took about 15 mins which is quite fast. We arrived 9pm in the evening. No queue at all. The room is clean. But it just smell bad. I think the carpet actually stink like old unmaintained building. Asking for extra pillow, they actually gave it after we insisted it. First they did not want to deliver the pillow as the cleaning service is closed. Strange.  We both has very bad alergies after staying in the hotel. For the price we paid, i don't think its worth it."
Hotel of this quality doesnt deserve to be even in Paharganj,Date of stay: August 2019,10,I am not sure if i can post the photo of the buffet breakfast area without breaking any privacy law. So i wont do it.  This hotel is an absolute avoid . You dont deserve such a punishment. Kindly do yourself a favour and choose only branded hotels cos only those ones have anything to lose.  This hotel is usually given to the people who get the cheap packages to come to Singapore in bulk groups The room ends before it starts. The wifi speeds are same as they are at Delhi Railway station.  I cant forget the bread on the buffet breakfast table. The tea was horrible. The milk was half water and the ambience was same as of Chandni chowk. Why did I have to be in Singapore to suffer like this.  The best part was I reached the hotel at 9 45. I kept asking if I would get breakfast as my booking was from previous day. The lady kept me standing at the reception and kept on saying sorry as the buffet closes at 10. Isnt that height of customer centric dealing? Finally it was 10 n I could get nothing as its all our fault anyways.  Someone tell them to buy new towels please. They are -------- .
Budget Hotel. Decent Location,Date of stay: July 2019,40,"Well connected to the MRTs. Stations just 400-500 m on either side. Rooms are clean but old. Breakfast is limited, not a lot of options in the breakfast. Staff is courteous and approachable. Rooms are little bigger than average rooms in Singapore."
Happy stay excellent service,Date of stay: July 2019,50,My friends and myself would like to thank to one of your sales manager Mr warren for his excellent service. We was stuck in between few big crowd at lobby area around 8.40am and wanted to find our way to somerset subway station as this is the first time we visit singapore. This young man walk to us and offer his help asking what can he do for us and do we need any help. My friend told asked him which way to the subway station and he trying his best to explain and we still a bit lost. Thereafter he say please come with me I walk you to the nearest mall opposite the train station. I will definitely come back again and stay with this hotel. Good service from well trained employee
Disappointing,Date of stay: July 2019,10,"For such a lovely city was disappointed with the Hotel,on arrival we were given keys told room and that part okay.got inside room so small couldn’t fit our two cases in lucky there was a single bed there and one of suitcases sat there.then decided to put goods into safe didn’t work tried ringing no answer on service dial 1. There was no book in room explaining about place emenities tv etc like most hotels.so had to go to reception to tell them,someone arrived to fix safe and when left said no charge.We just looked at one another in shock as we had only just walked into room to find it like that... then had trouble working tv and wasn’t game to go down stairs again incase we get charged..no booklet to explain the tv and stations they had like in all hotels I’ve ever stayed at even ones on very low ratings. Breakfast was just adequate had to workout what things were tea and coffee Luke warm. Place very noisy both because of road and noisey patrons coming and going during the night and early morning not caring how much noise they made.Only good thing close to shopping on Orchard rd"
Arrogant Staff & Lousy Management,Date of stay: July 2019,10,"A basic hotel for 1 night stay is just what we want while visiting Singapore for half day. Saw this hotel offering a room at an unbelievable price online, we booked and paid since its really a good deal!  I left my contact number & email address while making the reservation, at least the Hotel could reach me should there problem with my confirmed booking since the price is too good to be real.... waited for 7 days, no one from hotel has ever contacted me. So, I believe hotel is giving a genuine discount! How nice right?!  Upon check-in, we were caught in surprise because we are told to pay for the room.  Here’s the points that we couldn’t agree with: 1. Guests are told to pay extra ONLY upon check-in despite the reservation was confirmed a week prior to check-in, hotel has 7 days to reach the guest for any necessarily explanation. But failed.  2. Arrogant staff, Mary handled us unprofessionally. She told us the price we have to pay, the rate stated on our confirmation was wrong due to system breaches. I do know mistake can happened but hotel has the responsibility to contact the guest for explanation, in my case, they have 7 days to inform before we travel to Singapore from Malaysia. They failed.  3. No one from the hotel has the courtesy to contact us for but telling us they won’t honour our booked rate unless we pay. Well, I have to say the price they are asking is not unreasonably high considering the average rate for hotels in Singapore. However, we refused to be treated this way. They have no courtesy but arrogantly told us “there is no hotel with this price in Singapore, you SHOULD know!”  4. Worst! Mary told us, I can give you the money you have paid now if you don’t want to stay! I COULDN’T BELIEVE IT! Where should we go and how can we find another hotel at this very moment where we traveled all the way from Malaysia? Please imagine if you are being treated this way.  At that moment, we decided to get our confirmation honoured no matter what, we don’t even deserved to be treated this way. Look here, if hotel made mistake to load the rate online then please honour it. Should never blame guests being “naive” to think they got a good deal!!!!  My advice to all fellow travellers here, NEVER EVER believe the rate they published online."
Good property but they need to improve on Indian breakfast !!!,Date of stay: June 2019,40,I stayed here with the group. Rooms are okay. Location is good. Staff is polite and friendly. Buffet Breakfast for Indian guests was not up to the mark. They served only Wada without chutney. They were serving Ketchup instead of Chutney. The guests also complained about the fried rice which was served as one of the items in the breakfast. Some of the items in the breakfast menu was repeated during our 3 nights stay.
Dunno where to start,Date of stay: June 2019,20,"Check in time is 3pm. Arrived in the hotel at 10am. Lobby was packed with guests all from either checking out or checking in. Nowhere to rest from an early morning flight.  Room was ok. The shower floor needs a good amount of scrubbing. Carpet needs steam cleaning. The tv was useless. They were only about 10 channels, 6 of which are Chinese/Mandarin. No cable tv.  Rooftop pool is noisy during night time because of hotel's vents/aircon sitting 5 metres away from the pool. When I went in, nobody was in there. Wouldn't wonder why. Not a very relaxing spot during the night.  Food. Terrible. Not enough choices. Tried their brekfast buffet only for 1 day. Did not come back the 2nd day though I paid brekky for 2 days. Greasy ham. Only 1 fruit was served. No coffee machine.  Dont waste your money here. Go somewhere else."
"Small room, same breakfast, arrogant staff",Date of stay: June 2019,10,"We were booked at this Hotel on a Thomas Cook package . The hotel lacks basic facilities, a small double room in which a third bed was crammed in . The same breakfast menu for 4 days consisting of fried oily stuff and to top it none of the hotel staff or the Thomas cook staff did anything about the same  also arrogant front office staff , avoid this hotel as well as Thomas cook as they lured us by offering ibis or similar and then gave us this hotel which was no comparison to IBIS at the last minute"
"Good location, nice room, bad breakfast",Date of stay: June 2019,40,"I stayed at Chancellor for 4 nights so since I was in triple occupancy, my room size was pretty good with a garden view. I was happy with the room and hotel as I only spent my nights and rest of the way went wandering around. Hotel location is very good as it surrounds all expensive brands to Lucky Market which is a cheap store. The hotel is located on the Orchard road and everything is near to it. One can take a Grab and roam around wherever they want to. Hotel staff is courteous.  Breakfast is really bad as the same meal is repeated each day and you don’t have any option but to end up eating a bread toast, boiled egg and watermelon."
Pathetic poor disgusting,Date of stay: June 2019,10,"Such a bad hotel. Confusion at the time of check in. Smelly rooms, toiletries bellow par, Faulty equipment and hot water fell on my daughter. Their staff refused first aid and on mail follow up they are saying they are investigating the matter. Would not recommend to anyone. Even staff is rude including the managers at buffet etc!"
This hotel is criminal and should be charged and closed!!!,Date of stay: June 2019,10,"Travelling abroad with your family is always special, but i have to give it to hotel chancellor orchard, they really know how to ruin it. Imagine, communicating with them online with my requirements such as the adjoining / connecting rooms which is very crucial because i have three small kids to look after, having them reply that adjoining / connecting rooms is based on availability, i will try my luck hoping it will be available upon our arrival. Here comes the kicker, upon check in, they said that the hotel DOES NOT HAVE AN ADJOINING / CONNECTING ROOM?!?!? What the @&#!?! They further explained that “they will see what they can provide” adding insult to injury!?!? Am i stupid? I travelled a lot, i won’t go to anplace where in my room status is not clear, i specifically demanded an adjoining / connecting room, why make a promise that the room type is based on availability when you do not have such room type?!?!? This is a clear case of fraud! You fooled us that you can provide If i knew that your s@&!# hotel was that s@&!# not having an adjoining / connecting room, I would not have booked my family to stay there. I demand a full refund plus damages!!!"
"""how is this even a star hotel""",Date of stay: June 2019,10,"I had gone to Singapore as a trip. I stayed in this hotel and the experience was terrible.  The room is small.  Food is terrible, not good at all.  they don't treat Indians well.  Overall a bad experience.  Tough the location is good."
They don't deserve to called as Hotel or Hospitality industry partner,Date of stay: May 2019,10,"This Hotel is Nightmare for all the travellers from india Right from the most arrogant front end staff followed by rude Service staff More so they ill treat Indian travellers  A big no to all the travellers from india  I haven't seen such Stupid hotel and the most arrogant staff ever in my life so far , the hotel room has no amenities and it is like a dormitory  Please refrain from guys , the ones who visit even after reading review, please be prepared for nuisances  Choice is yours"
Mini vacation,Date of stay: May 2019,40,"The reception area, lift area, rooms, etc. were cozy. Breakfast not upto mark, Indian breakfast included idli/vada but without chutney and sambhar. Samosa not tasty and full of oil. No omlets, only boiled eggs."
Short stay,Date of stay: May 2019,40,Location is fine. Staffs were very friendly and assistive in printing a few tickets but the breakfast was not so good. My rating was actually average but 1 more star for the Front Desk Manager who helped me print my tickets. People are really the assets in any businesses.
Pathetic Front office Desk,Date of stay: April 2019,10,I was there for a family vacation for 4 days and the service at the front desk is pathetic and food is also bad especially the breakfast and in my stay of 4 days i went to front desk for enabling my keys for 15 times...so you can imagine the service offered
"Hotel by name and by chance. Beware the ""glowing"" reviews.",Date of stay: May 2019,30,"Agoda had been my hotel booking of choice and this time, I picked up Hotel Chancellor at Orchard after checking out the photos of the hotel (especially the pool) and the location representing itself as in the City center.  I thought it was assured. Not by a long shot. First, the plus factors. Since Chancellor is OUT of the city location, traffic is light. The rooms are clean, even the curtains barely have a speck of dust. The concierge was spacious and there seems to be a shortage of worker at the time we checked in because the Front Office Manager was the one who got us the room cards and information.  Of course in Singapore, you have to have your passport ready all the time: from when you purchase a prepaid SIM card at the airport (which Changi had metamorphosed into a multi-storied mall!) to checking at the hotel and more.  Warning! Please bring a Singapore-friendly adapter, a three pronged adapter since the US and Philippine adapters will NOT work. And to add insult to injury, the hotel does not provide a loaner. In Seoul, the hotel provides adapters although you have to have a deposit - which you can get upon check out.  The Chancellor does not see it worth the while of the hotel nor worth the convenience of hotel guests to have adapters. The toilet and shower skimped on space. Forest Lodge of Baguio has bigger rooms and roomy toilet and shower at third of the price.  Cleaning ladies barely speak English and most would ask you to talk to the supervisor - even for an extra soap or face towel.  I agree with tinagargopal's review that this hotel is ""Bad, bad, bad."""
central & reasonable,Date of stay: September 2018,50,This hotel was chosen after our airbnb got canceled on the last minute and i'm glad i chose this hotel. reasonable price with just being minutes away from orchard. the train station is only 5 mins away. there is food around the hotel as well. rooms were great we had connecting rooms. stay here if you dont want to spend so much on a hotel but want to be in the city at the same time! we'll be back!
Horrible stay away,Date of stay: March 2019,10,Rooms were dirty. Someone else’s hair all through the bathroom as well as feceis on the outside of the toilet that wasn’t cleaned our entire stay (was there when we arrived). Rooms were very small. Breakfast was inedible don’t waste your time on that. Service was also terrible. Spoke to staff and they would ignore you and serve other more ‘important’ guests.
Bad bad bad,Date of stay: March 2019,10,"Let's start with check in/check out process. The lobby design and how they manage the crowd at peak hours, is poor. There's no proper system of which guest came 1st and which guest next... Confusion confusion. The room was okay. Clean sheets and towels. Enough amenities, although I would have appreciated some Q-Tips. They have a water dispenser affixed in the room, instead of water bottles, which is good. Reduces plastic waste. Elevator speed and waiting time is good. The restaurant located at level 2 is the real deal breaker. I arrived at night and was tired to go out for dinner. I chose to eat at the restaurant. They don't offer much in their menu and even from that few choices half of it was not available. That really spoils my mood. Be very very careful when using the cutlery. It's not properly clean. I noticed this every day for the 3 days I stayed. Even during the morning breakfast. Always wipe your cutlery with a tissue before using. It's even sticky at times. There's also a bird flying around picking food from everywhere. The bun has some insects perched on it. It looks like the fruit fly. Hygiene issue is a huge thing for me and for this reason alone, I will not be returning to this hotel, ever."
Very very disappointed,Date of stay: March 2019,10,"We recently travelled there in March. When we went to check in they wanted payment first, never have had this before. The invoice she gave us was different to the one I booked and printed off. It said king room with breakfast. The girl at reception said no breakfast and price was correct and no king rooms. Lucky I had my copy other wise she would have charged us the price she printed off. Also if we did not pay for the room they would not allow us to go to our booked room. The room was small and no king bed. The bathroom is so small it is difficult for 2 of us to be there. Also to get in the bath to have a shower is terrible. It is too high and if you have leg and feet problems you cannot have a shower. There are no draws in the room, not even one small one. Very disgusting as you have nowhere to put any clothes that you cannot hang up. So they have to stay in the suitcase, again disgusting. Now going to breakfast, I was in shock when I went and saw the rubbish they had on the tables. On the weekend the food was almost nothing. There was no brown bread only white and if you wanted butter or jam or anything else good luck as soon As the bowl was empty the staff said there was no more. The staff there had no respect were very rude, no hello, no good morning, no can I help you. Just nothing. The breakfast had yuki dry chips only one type of fruit and some cereal. The scrambled eggs look like they were powered eggs. There juice was like cordial. On the week days they added some more bowls with pancakes etc. to me still not eatable. And again when we went there on Monday they said that we had to pay for breakfast. I was so upset I was going to leave, I was sick and tired that I had to keep telling them we had paid for breakfast. The room that they checked us in was disgusting the porter opened the door and it stunk of cigarettes. The smell was awful with my asthma it did not help. So we went back to reception to tell them, they did not believe us and thought that we smoked. We were lucky the porter was with us and told them it was full of cigarette smoke. It took another 30 minutes to find another so called room. A new hotel that does not know how to treat their customers. Will never stay there again. Also the bed mattress was as hard as a rock. Did not help my back. The pillows also hard."
3D2N,Date of stay: March 2019,20,"Went for a meeting in SG. Our flight was early in the morning and reach the hotel at 11ish. The staff kind enough to allow us to check in early.  In city center. Walking distance to orchard road. Easy to get grab.  Room pretty decent. We added one more bed, just nice in 1 room. Not too spacious tho.  Toilet pretty small. Have basic amenities.  Thumbs down on breakfast. Starts at 7am. We went down at 8am. No cutleries and cups. Take so long for them to replenish. Food spread were sad. Please opt no to have it in the hotel. Staff with attitude! We asked to clean up a table since there was no other table available. She rolled her eyes and pause few secs. She doesn’t even look presentable! It’s like she just got up from her bed not brushing her teeth and hair. Euwwh! We didnt go down on 2nd day. We rather walked to SG plaza and had mcd for breakfast.  Would have rate 3 stars if not because of the breakfast incident."
Basic Hotel - Not recommended,Date of stay: September 2018,20,"Located closely to MRT Stations 5mins by walk. However, the whole hotel was extremely strange smelly and the rooms are small. Especially, breakfast was horrible. Wifi is not wrong. Everything needs to be improved!"
Bad Service,Date of stay: February 2019,10,"The duty manager doesn’t know how to check us in since we booked through online, and he has to wait for his colleage to do it for him. The room have no amenities, we requested before we left the hotel to do sight seeing but we when we came back at the hotel, the things we requested still not arrived. They answer calls in the front desk after the fifth time i called. It is just my first few hours here but I can say we are already not having a good time in this hotel nor ejoying our stay."
"Great location, great staff and good price",Date of stay: February 2019,50,"The location it’s great! Beautiful area, near to bus stops, shops, restaurants, shopping centers, etc. It was a rooftop pool very clean. The best... the staff! They are very helpful, kind and really try to help you out with anything you need: phone calls, places, taxi, etc. The only thing they have to work on a little bit more is in the cleanest in the breakfast area, (because people don’t help very much!). But overall we highly recommend this hotel."
Location is good. The rest is very ordinary.,Date of stay: February 2019,10,We stayed in a very small room with minimal facilities. The restaurant refused to cater for my gluten fee (coeliac) requirements and suggested that we visit a local supermarket to purchase our food. The shower in the room fluctuated dangerously from hot to cold and the water pressure was abysmal and toilet flushing required several attempts. The lobby and elevators were usually full of large travelling groups causing inconvenient congestion. This place might be cheap but we suggest you spend a few extra $ and make your stay in this beautiful city comfortable.
Best Location but,Date of stay: January 2019,40,"The best part of the hotel is its location. It is close to many important points and is on the main road. Another best part I liked in this hotel is the water dispensing system. There is a water dispenser which provides hot and cold water throughout 24 hrs. for drinking or coffee/tea making. However, I found many minus points , such as rooms are a bit smaller, and were not cleaned by the time we checked in. Management take every thing so easily and did not bother about the guests. Bathrooms are alright. Another negative aspect is the Breakfast. It is very meagre and choices are very less. Even the quantities are poor, most of the time they were not refilled immediately. Staff are the worst part in this hotel. At the breakfast their treatment is very bad and when I asked a staff for the clean plates he told me to go to the other side of the counter and get it. He did not bother to bring, I was in the long que and happened to leave it and get it by myself. I don't know why tour operators like Cox n Kings are preferring this hotel. Personally I do not recommend this hotel to any one. Last but not least , the elevator is located in one end of the hotel and not central, therefore, we have to walk a long distance to reach our rooms. So beware while selecting the rooms."
Great location,Date of stay: January 2019,40,As we only stayed two nights it's difficult to give an elaborate review. The rooms are clean but not especially spacious. The staff were efficient & the concierge was especially helpful storing our luggage. The pool area nothing to write home about but it's grand for a quick dip after some sightseeing. The breakfast was a bit strange as well. No cold milk only hot and but this is only a quibble. Location is excellent; about 10 minutes walk to Dhoby Ghaut or Orchard MRT stations.
singapore,Date of stay: December 2018,30,"the hotel is situated very close to business establishment, shopping malls (along orchard road), food courts, buses and metro. it's clean and non of our things were lost. it's a mile & a half away from the starting line as we've registered for a half marathon for the standard chartered 2018"
Cafeteria staff is rude,Date of stay: January 2019,10,"They are not providing water bottles in the room. Each room is having water dispenser. When I asked how it is working, they told me to come lobby for demo. They have two cafeterias. One is having good interior and one is old. One day I had breakfast in new one but next day they told me that my breakfast is in other cafeteria. Menu is same everyday. They don't have good staff. All are frustrated."
Housekeeping 'used' our toilet and shower,Date of stay: January 2019,10,"Arriving, the room given to us was very small and misrepresented by the photos we saw. Unfortunately, our experience declined further on our second day. After returning from a full day exploring the city, we walked in our hotel room to find that someone had recently used the shower and toilet, leaving the bathroom floor obviously wet, and the toilet used (not flushed). Consequently, the room had a disgusting odour arising from the toilet. Immediately, we brought this to the attention of the concierge and duty manager who responded with ""Oh, housekeeping must not have cleaned properly."" After explaining graphically that neither of us had used the toilet to that degree, the duty manager stated he would check the security footage and get back to us, and send housekeeping up to re-clean our room. Unfortunately, neither solutions were actioned. Returning from dinner, a change in shifts had occurred and the duty manager dealing with our complaint was not available, neither had our room been re-cleaned. As we checked out early the next morning we questioned the new duty manager regarding our complaint, as we had to sleep in the dirty room all night with no communication from the hotel staff. The new duty manager stated once again that ""we must have been unhappy with the standard of cleaning."" However, upon explaining the true situation, the manager looked into the initial manager's actions explaining to us that ""a report had been written and that housekeeping was aware, as they were the only ones that entered (according to the manager's recollection of the footage)"". Giving no apologies aside from ""sorry"" as we checked out.  Unsettling us the most, was that we had to sleep in a room that had been entered and used by a member of staff or the public overnight, with no communication or resolution, or even apologies from the staff, until WE re-initiated the conversation on check-out the next morning."
Unimpressed,Date of stay: January 2019,30,"Bed and pillows were fine, but the bathroom was terrible. Very bad water pressure. Barely enough to wash soap off. Shower temp would not stay stable, would be very hot then change to very cold then back again, never just warm. Bath is higher than floor, so a big step down when you step out of the bath/shower. Could be dangerous if you were not prepared for it. A/C is quite noisy. Do not like the built in water filter/heater, i much prefer bottled water."
Strategic & Comfortable Hotel,Date of stay: December 2018,40,"Inexpensive price but worth to stay for you who wish to escape short vacation, clean which located close to the middle of famous orchard road, for shophacholic its good place to find and easy to reach MRT station. Recommended to stay here! If you book this hotel, ensure to request highy flower so that you will find a beautiful greeny view from your window."
New year's stay,Date of stay: December 2018,10,"My family consists of 4 members. It seemed like a hostile place for indians. One of the staff members who wears specs and manages breakfast on the 2nd floor was extremely rude. it so happened that one of the staff members asked our whole group of 41 people to keep our luggage on the 2nd floor outside the restraunt, we did so but as soon as this guy came he shouted on top of his lungs ""this not your home, remove the luggage from here "". This kind of treatment is totally uncalled for. Instead of welcoming us with a welcome drink, we were told to go outside on the 2nd floor and sit without an AC. I asked for toiletries by calling their housekeeping number, they did refused to give it saying they don't have it and I should I my tour guide for the same. Why will my tour manager keep brushes /combs / bathroom slippers ??? On the next morning I obtained it from the cleaning lady and she happily gave it. The food was random,one of the days they removed the toaster from the place we ate. Horrible treatment of guests. This is no way to behave. Would never recommend anyone to go there. While the place was decent, the behaviour really put me off. And I had gone with my family to celebrate New year's this year. Horrendous experience"
Very ordinary,Date of stay: December 2018,20,We had booked this hotel through booking com and was for $250 a night with breakfast included. Unfortunately we left the paper work at home showing this . But when we arrived to be charged $290 a room with no breakfast. They have removed kettles and placed with some hot/ cold water urn that didn’t work properly. No bottled water on arrival I’m not normally one to complain but I would never recommend this hotel
I'd look elsewhere!,Date of stay: December 2018,20,"Pros: 1. The housekeeping staff were good. 2. Good-not-great location. 3. Facility to cloak your luggage in case you arrive early and wish to roam around till you're allotted a room.  Cons: 1. The rooms were not as promised at the time of checking in. 2. Premium room is a joke. Please do not pay for it. 3. The breakfast buffet is atrocious, boring and extremely redundant. 4. All in all, it felt like a total rip off. Far better hotels available in the same price range."
Good position no good for breakfast,Date of stay: December 2018,30,"Really really interesting for this position, in one of the most important street in Singapore in the center. Just not really good for the breakfast very poor and nothing for European people even if is a star hotel. Just a normal hotel."
Convenient & strategic hotel in Orchard Road.,Date of stay: November 2018,30,"Second time staying here after a year ago, this place has offered the mpst convenient location with moderate price available in busy east side of Orchard shopping road.  Next to Grand Central hotel & behind Concordia hotel & across Gateway plaza & Orchard Point old plaza. Also 200m away from Singapore Plaza & 313 mall.  All shopping malls in Orchard are by walking distances.  The room is small but convenient for biz & couple room. Unlimited free hot & cold & regular water vending machine.  Bathroom & bathup is rather small even for Asian size. But it's ok to have a quick shower"
THE Chancellor of Singapore,Date of stay: September 2018,50,"Stayed over en route to Phuket - the quietest room EVER! Conveviently close to two tube stops & hop on/off bus stop (BUT bus colours very confusing & stops badly marked/sign posted) & shops. It has a roof top pool (lo-o-ng!) with stunning views! Very efficient, helpful staff & concierge. louis-THE-lawyer"
Do not choose this hotel. It’s ridiculous.,Date of stay: October 2018,10,"Worst hotel in Singapore. Terrible staff members. No courtesy was shown. Terrible rooms. It’s was the worst experience of my entire journey to Singapore and Malaysia. I got a room with broken table and when I asked reception desk to change my room, they literally refused in a manner that was really ridiculous for something We’ve paid for. If you are planning to visit Singapore I would request you to NOT choose this hotel. If you choose you’ll definitely spoil your holiday."
Hidden Gem in the midst of all the Giants.,Date of stay: November 2018,40,"I don't usually stay in the heart of the city especially in touristy places. However, this was booked by my company for a business trip and it was good. The rooms were clean and I loved the rooftop swimming pool. Location wise, it was strategically located nearby two MRT station and Orchard road itself is just a few minutes walk away."
Amazing.,Date of stay: August 2018,50,The water dispenser for drinking to reduce plastic bottled water is amazing. Very clean rooms. Room is small but enough for two people. Easy access to Orchard road too. I am definitely coming again to this hotel.
Nice and must give a chance...,Date of stay: October 2018,40,"Rooms are good, location is nearer to centre of Singapore. Round the clock service. But Buffet breakfast needs improvement. In-house gift shop has sim cards and currency facilities and its really helpful and you can pick up some gifts as well."
BAD Service,Date of stay: October 2018,10,"Checked in with friends and prior to our arrival at th hotel, our business associates sent our luggage for safe keeping with the hotel. Up in arrival at the hotel, i approached the staff to retrieve our luggage. How ever th reply was for us to pick up retrieve ourselves ad he has only 2 hands... WTF did not I even ask him to carry just checking where can we retrieve. So UNPROFESSIONAL. Listeb t your guest 1st before speaking. Will never come back to this hotel."
i spent not much time in hotel,Date of stay: October 2018,30,"Hotel is big but room & bed are very very small. I used twin bed and i could not turn around. Wash room is no lock so not really convenienct when stay with partner. There is no standard amenities like razor, comb, toilet carpet.... Staffs are not really helpful, not smile at all. Breakfast is repeat and repeat with poor quality."
Very good value,Date of stay: October 2018,40,"the hotel is not very fancy, but the rooms are nicely done and clean, the location is very good (very close to Dhoby Ghaut SMRT, close to the original Killiney coffee shop, close to Orchard station). Staff friendly and helpful, breakfast is what to be expected in this price range, but good. Overall good value for money Beware however the rooms facing night clubs - these tend to be very noisy until early morning. Ask for quiet room."
Bed is too small,Date of stay: October 2018,30,"I had 4 nights here. Room is quite small. Toilet has no lock. Amenities are very poor, no comb, no cotton buds, no razor. location is very good for MRT, shopping mall and food courts. Bed is too small. Breakfast is so simple Sorry, I won't come back."
Nice Hotel with a Great location,Date of stay: October 2018,40,"Hotel Chancellor is a nice and well located hotel. Orchard Road and its shopping treats are right around the corner and the Dhoby Ghaut MRT stop is a short walk away. Check-in was quick and easy. The room was a bit small, but was sufficient for our sleeping needs (we were out most of the day). Breakfast was average- nothing remarkable, but provided enough to get our day going. Lots of big tour groups were staying at the hotel during our time there. The only issues that caused were an incredibly crowded lobby at times and some waiting for an elevator. Our room was quiet and not affected by those groups. Overall, it was a good stay. I would stay there again."
Average,Date of stay: October 2018,30,"Stayed here 4 nights for a business trip in Singapore. Location was good that near the MRT Stations, shopping malls and street food restaurants. Room was cozy but bed was very small (just 0.8m width). Almost nothing for bathroom amenities: no razor, no comb, no toothbrush, no slippery. Buffet was poor and unchanged in 4 days I stayed here. They had a nice swimming pool on rooftop, but pity I had no time to enjoy :))"
3* Hotel without basic facilities,Date of stay: September 2018,20,"During our stay, we face many problems. Main problems like NO lock on the bathroom door! only 50MB Wifi per stay! rooms are not clean... much dust on the table and storage area. Breakfast very basic, very few options and no proper reply by staff. Even we are in a group and they have advance information, but still, they take 2 hrs for prosses and key!!! Not-at-all happy with our stay..."
Ok for the price,Date of stay: September 2018,30,"I stayed the Grand Prix weekend and to the hotels credit they were one of the few which didn’t increase their rate 3 or 4 times over normal. Even though I booked well in advance I checked in late and was told no queen size beds were left so I got two single beds. I was offered room 1047 on the top floor which offered basic decoration but was clean. Even though I bought the highest grade room I got no view at all, just looking into the next tower which was quite close by. It was misleading compared to the photos shown on the website. I should have booked the cheapest room instead. An armchair was provided in the room which was good but the tv offered very limited channels. The WiFi wouldn’t connect but a polite gentleman on the front desk knew a work around, it was high speed once connected. The bathroom was compact with a shower over the bath. The step into the bath was far too high and quite dangerous in my view and the water temperature in the shower surged from cold to scolding hot water, inconvenient but borderline dangerous too. Breakfast on 2nd floor offered good variety and quality with plenty of seating and staff cleared the tables very quickly. WiFi access in the breakfast was patchy. Overall it was a basic hotel, clean with good staff, however it always felt busy with lots of rooms per floor."
"Average hotel, average service",Date of stay: October 2018,10,"We stayed at this hotel mainly because of the location on Orchard Road. While the location was OK, everything else was not. The carpet in our room was dirty and looked like it had never been vacuumed. The bed was dusty and again looked like they had never cleaned the place. The room was tiny, especially the bath room and our room keys hardly ever worked in the lift or to get into our room. After politely asking the staff for a new room key because ours weren’t working they gave us some and sent us back up. This happened 4 times going up and down the lift because none of them were working. By the end of our trip we had 5 cards because of this issue and staff weren’t helpful at all. On our 2nd night we had to change rooms because our air con stopped working. We were told someone would call us when our new room was ready. After an hour of no one calling us we phoned the front desk at 10.30PM and finally got a new room. Not that they helped us with our luggage or anything though. I definitely won’t be coming back to stay at this hotel. Do yourself a favour and stay near Marina Bay instead."
Good location reasonable hotel,Date of stay: October 2018,40,This is exactly what we needed. Modest price for Singapore ($150 Aud). Facilities straightforward. Clean. Well serviced room. No frills. 9th floor had skyline view. Pool looked good but did not use  Desk staff helpful. Usually a small wait as they have a lot of people to serve. Did not try the breakfast because of advisor reviews. Good location. Easy access to MRT. Food stall eateries over the road.  Strongly recommend visit to Singapore Tourist office to identify what you might want to do and the tourist MRT card as cheap effective way to get around.
WORST HOTEL I EVER STAYED IN,Date of stay: October 2018,10,"The only good thing about this hotel is location. And they do not have any customer service. All they want is money for everything.  Even with rooms available for early check in, they make you wait and say it's company policy and the duty manager said that company wants him to make more money.  Zero client satisfaction and service  Breakfast WAS REALLY BAD. No variety and the service standard was zero  Do not stay here ever."
Avoid,Date of stay: October 2018,10,"This hotel is impressive on the outside. But inside is an other story. They have the porter trolles but you take your own luggage out if the taxi and to your room. Upon arrival at room there were no toiletries, House keeping gcaming and they made me feel like I was wrong for asking. Then the TV did not work. But they fixed . But for what. They had no channels for English speaking people. Not even HBO or movie chanel. There was no cold water supplied only a water dispenser that only gave hit or warm. The shower entry would have to be the most dangerous to people I have ever come across and I have traveled to many countries and I am in the building industry. This is very unsafe. Also the water in the shower goes from cold to extremely hot no matter what setting you have it on. They don't give you swimming towels and you have to use bath towels and when you ask to replace these for your night shower (or scalding) they seem reluctant to do so. Room cleaning each day is of a basic nature as toiletries seem to be only supplied on arrival as I had to ask for everything every day. I would not recommend you to stay here as I do not think this hotel lives up to its star rating and customer service does not exist."
Hotel Chancellor,Date of stay: April 2018,30,"The Hotel Chancellor is in a great location , close to the bus station, shopping, and eateries. The Hotel room was clean and roomy enough for two people. Breakfast is an additional charge of $20 . The hotel lobby is small and crowded at times."
Pathetic hotel,Date of stay: October 2018,10,I stayed in this hotel for 4 days. Its a pathetic hotel to stay. No options for vegitarians in breakfast except chane n potato wedges. They serve same breakfast everyday. N even staff is not courteous. Very rude seems they have problem with Indians. Will not recommended this hotel to anyone. Only thing i find good is location.
👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾,Date of stay: September 2018,40,"Small but very well maintained room. Staff was friendly, helpful and efficient. Kudos to Staff MARK, who was able to attend my issues and concerns. Food was average. Good location! Definitely recommend to my friends and family!"
Feel good,Date of stay: September 2018,40,"Nice room...nice greating..nice customer service..near mrt station somerset..i recomended this hotel.. Few minutes walking..?? Orchard road... And i like this hotel because little bit quiet..so, thx . ."
Avg Hotel,Date of stay: September 2018,30,"The best thing about hotel is its location. You can catch a metro and go to any main tourist attraction in a minute.  Rooms are okay, not so spacious, but good enough to sleep.  The worst thing about hotel is its breakfast menu. It's the same whether you are a Chinese or Indian. They don't change their menu at all. For veges, they have only dal and bread.  In Non veg, they have only sausages, scrumbled eggs (no manchurian) even in fruit platter they have only watermelon.  Keep this in mind while booking this hotel  Rest is good."
Fantastic location.,Date of stay: August 2018,40,"Great hotel. The location was great, just one block from Orchard road and a short walk to the MRT station. Not large rooms but big enough. Comfy bed and having a bath was great although if you have trouble climbing in a bath you might have a problem, the bath is quite deep. The water dispenser was fabulous. Breakfast was great, lots of variety. We would definitely stay there again."
"Great location, courteous staff, good room",Date of stay: September 2018,40,"I booked a double room, and the size was good enough for Singapore standards, because Singapore is expensive and most hotel rooms are not big as per Indian standards. The staff was amazing! There was such a rush, but they were not irritated by the horde of customers asking them questions, including me. The check in time is 3 PM, so if you're reaching early, will suggest you to book for the day prior as well, so that you can rest as soon as you reach. Breakfast spread was awesome. Location is prime. There are small outlets right below the hotel which remain open till late night."
Its an average hotel with minimal facilities...,Date of stay: July 2018,30,"First the staff are not expressive in explaining the facilities available in the hotel...this is big disappointment... Very very limited food options for proper vegetarians in this hotel..  Pros: Very well maintained rooms, eventhough they are pretty small.. Hotel vicinity on orchard road..."
Don’t believe the negative reviews - this hotel is great!,Date of stay: September 2018,50,"Booked this hotel back in March for F1 Grand Prix 2018 visit for 4 nights. Was a little bit nervous because of some of the negative reviews and was expecting the worst but much to my surprise it was great and I could not find fault with it. It definitely meets all you would expect from a 3 star hotel and more! We arrived at around 8pm and were greeted warmly by the gentleman on duty and we were thankful that the check in was very smooth and we were able to go out and explore Singapore by 8.15pm! Our room was on the 9th floor. There are 4 elevators and they were extremely efficient with hardly a minute’s wait.The room was a good size with large windows shaded by blackout and sheer curtains looking out to another hotel but the view was not unpleasant at all. The room was clean with great decor and nicely set up. We asked for extra pillows and they were in our room when we got back. The room and bathroom appeared to be newly renovated or just in great nick. The bathroom was small but had a bathtub, great to have a soak after traversing the balmy streets of Singapore. The location was great with just a few minutes walk to to lots of restaurants and bars including the popular Cuppage Plaza. We were in Singapore for the F1 Grand Prix and IMHO it was the most economical option with Dhoby Ghout being 5 minutes walk for access to the Pit Stop area and Somerset a 7 minutes walk for access to the Padang and Stamford grandstands. The location is also great for Orchard Road shopping. The breakfast was average but fine for the cost. The dining room is very large so would accommodate a huge number of people. The staff were efficient and helpful. The water dispenser in the room is unreal! Instant hot/cold water at the press of a button. Tea, coffee etc was complimentary. Best of all the room had an iron and ironing board which is quite rare for a 3 star hotel. I would also like to mention the service and friendly staff. Our TV went on the blink (I think we were pressing too many buttons on the remote) and within 10 minutes of reporting it it was fixed and received a follow up phone call from reception to check if it was ok. I would definitely stay at Hotel Chancellor again on my next visit to Singapore."
Wouldn't stay here again!,Date of stay: September 2018,20,"You think this hotel would read there reviews! Location of the hotel was perfect. Close to Dhoby Ghaut station which will get you easily to all the major tourist spots without having to change lines. Now for this hotel. I recommend getting room only. There is a star bucks around the corner. Cocktail sausages, hot chips and pasta for breakfast.....seriously 😬 the juice and milk were very synthetic! Your fruit was apples and an ad hoc water melon. The room was extremely basic! Shower constantly went hot and cold. No kettle apart from an instant boiler machine that was noisy (good luck sleeping) Tea and coffee in the room pretty much non existent so pack your own. Two mugs and two plastic spoons that don't get replaced so hide them if you want to use them for your entire stay. Couple of the plugs in our room didn't work and half the skirting board was falling off. TV we couldn't get to work. And the room smelt funny. The pool was ok, they could make this a lot better with very little money. The pool furniture needs to be upgraded. We got to the pool ok but on the way back the elevator did not work (out of order) so down the stairs we went! Luckily our door to our floor was not locked."
Economy at the heart of the city,Date of stay: August 2018,50,We stayed in this hotel with the family for 4 days. The stay was reasonable good and comfortable. Bathrooms are small may be due to space crunch in the city. It is ideally located with surroundings. Breakfast was nice and tastier. Overall stay was comfortable. For early checking the rate charged seems high. The booking was done through Trip Factory
"Average Hotel, good location",Date of stay: April 2018,30,"We stayed for 3 nights in Apr 2018; the room quite small and smelly from bathroom. Bfast is very poor and crowded of group travellers But the location is good, near the shopping malls on Orchard Road, good for shoppers"
Comfortable For stopover stay,Date of stay: September 2018,30,"Comfortable basic rooms, hotel is situated within an easy walk to Plaza Singapura on Orchard Rd. Rooms are quiet and clean, Check in is fast and painless. Basic facilities but still a worthwhile place to stay if you have business at that end of town."
Common problem but not willing to solve.,Date of stay: September 2018,20,"Due to last minute emergency trip to SG, I had to book several places for my teammates and one of the hotel I booked was Hotel Chancellor for its location and reviews. However, I was disappointed by the service from check-in to solving problem after hours.  Trainee helped me to check-in this evening, I am fine and supportive to trainees as I seen many in my own company. Today's receptionist front desk was a trainee with no smile on her face but it was ok for me since we understand.  One of my teammate was given a room far end of many rooms on the highest floor. We wanted to ask for a change of room however time was tight for our next meeting, therefore we can only request after we done with our meeting around 11pm.  As a frequent traveller to many asian countries, it is extremely common for clients to request for room change due to many reason.  All I can see is an attitude of unwillingness to help. I am truly disappointed with my first experience here with the hotel and its customer service standards. I need a better answer and attitude to customers, better than this I expect. For this standard and level in the hospitality sector, I am sure they can do more than these. The front manager or officer, with another staff from the office was not smile at all. This makes the whole experience seems uncomfortable and doesn't feel like I am being treated as a guest of an above 3 star hotel.  More training on customer services and an attitude of willingness will make the whole experience from 0 to 100. All the best."
UNHAPPY CUSTOMER,Date of stay: August 2018,10,"POOR, The worst service ever had in my entire life of hotel experience. I put my room to DO NOT DISTURB, but somehow the cleaner came in and clean it anyway. PRIVACY MATTER!!!  Next, prior to my check out. The counter girl just came out to reqch the counter, so I asked her if I can conduct checkout to her counter, but she raised her hand for me to stop talking. Then I take breath to be patience. Then she ask what I want, then I told her that I want to check out, then when I gave her my room card, I forget that my other card still left in the room. Her responds was like “where is the other card? Go take”  WTF?! Atleast have the courtesy to say it nicely. BAD SERVICE. Not recommended at all. Very Poor."
"Good location, average hotel",Date of stay: August 2018,30,"As long as your expectations aren’t too high, this hotel,was perfectly adequate. Close to Orchard Rd with buses , MTR , hop on hop off bus and plenty of shops. Location was good. Lovely roof top swimming pool, lap pool, although you had to use your room towels. Our bedroom was very basic with very hard pillows and single beds. 2cups and 2plastic teaspoons. No toilet paper and no washing liquid was disappointing.toilet paper was given to us when we asked. Reception was often not well staffed and language was a bit of a barrier. Allow plenty of time with lifts when going down with luggage. We didn’t eat in the restaurant and as we were on the Singapore holiday Experience I am not sure of the room cost."
Great location,Date of stay: December 2017,40,"Just of the beaten track close to orchard road, great little eatery just beside the hotel, pavement cafe, hotel was lovely had great views of Singapore as room had full length Windows. Swimming pool was nice and clean and was just the thing to forget about the hustle and bustle going on around you. My only problem was the breakfast, it was a chaotic mess no one new where to go, even the staff had no idea what to do, most of the food was unedible, it was horrible, and we were segregated from the coach holidays at breakfast and there breakfasts looked so much better then ours, only eat her the once as couldn't stand the hustle and and mess that the hotel called breakfast time"
Ok lah.. Basic,Date of stay: July 2018,30,"Check in was slow as there was not enough staff working in the front desk at midday. Room was alright. The toilet was a bit dirty, but bearable. Access to public transport good (Somerset MRT station). Check-out also slow because there was only 1 staff working the front desk that morning."
Not recommend,Date of stay: August 2018,20,"Though it has some good points, it's generally disappointing.  - Room: I stayed there with my family but had no idea why I had to stay on a different floor from other family members, in a room at the very end of the corridor (room 754, far from the lifts). To go to my room, I had to walk through another door. The space between 2 doors were small, it was ridiculous and a bit scary. The room was ok: clean, had street view. The lamps were a little bit dim, there was no sleep lamp.  - Breakfast: poor buffet, few choices, repeated on the day after and crowded. There were bread, scambled eggs, boiled eggs, sausages, french fries (too thick), nooddles (not-good taste), rice, porridge, creal with milk, coffee, orange juice, watermelon.  - Air freshener in the corridor: Good smell but a bit too strong that it was uncomfortable.  - Group tourists: Most of the customers were group tourists. So the reception area was often crowded and noisy.  - Wifi: Hate this. The hotel provided 50 Mb for free but I could use it at all.  - Elavators: too slow and always crowded.  - Water dispenser: The best thing so far in this hotel. It's included in each room, provided both hot and cold water, very convenient.  -Location: It's good if you're a shopping lover. It's closed to Orchard Road (within walking distance) where there are a lot of shopping malls."
Bad Choice in Singapore,Date of stay: July 2018,10,"Booked this hotel for a stopover on the way home to Australia in July. This hotel should never be 3 stars, maybe 1 1/2stars We arrived early and our room was not ready. Ok. Asked could we go to a comfort room to freshen up and were directed to very dirty toilets. We have stayed in Singapore often and generally you are offered a swim and shower at the pool. Arrived in room to be further disappointed. moved a chair and found the floor underneath to be filthy. Room had poor lighting. Had to open curtains fully to read.On checkout day, we told male staff at desk about state of room and were ignored. We left our bags in storage ( an area partitioned off by low barrier) as we had a late flight. Came back to retrieve an umbrella and found the guy outside unloading a bus and all bags unattended. Could have taken anything at all and no-one would have noticed. This budget hotel seems to cater to low cost tour groups for single night stays and I will never stay here again. The only reason we picked it was for the location. A low quality hotel in the middle of a wonderful city"
"Worst hotel ever, hostel even better than this place",Date of stay: August 2018,10,"You should trust all the bad reviews here and go for something else even for lower price with better standard. Think twice before you book, my experience was painful. I have some personal request regarding my booking so I made many attempts to contact the hotel via email and even via booking platform after placing the booking but no avail. Nobody care to reply at all and it's the same concept when you arrive at the hotel too. The room has no amenities, no slippers, no toothbrushes, no iron, no notes, no directory. But the worst is the staff. If you want anything, go down to the reception and beg for it. They never anticipate your need but only giving excuses. The telephone in my room was broken for the first 2 nights, I went up and down to inform them many times but nobody care. Until the third day I gave up already and they finally got it fixed. Thanks goodness ! Very poor breakfast, canned sausages, tasteless scramble eggs, boring pasta every morning, bread and cheap croissants are provided together with green lettuces salad and vinegar dressing, some french fries or mashed potatoes, congee and condiments that's it. One of the day there was pancake but also tasteless. You are surrounded by unfriendly staffs, especially at the Reception area with all grumpy or cold faces, no emotion when talking to you.They did lend me an iron when I was asking for it but it didn't work at all. The iron table smelled full of mold. The bathroom also has urine smell and mold found around the shower wall and shower curtain. Our room key did not work, we went down to check with the receptionist and they acted like we stupid. According to their system, the key is working normally, said the Receptionist. I insisted that it's not working, eventually, i got a new key and guess what? It also didnt work.Finally, Bellman escorted me to my room, tested the key, again it also didnt work so he opened the door using master key and asked me to come down to change another key later instead of getting me a new key and have it deliver to my room. Speechless for a 3 star standard. Most of this hotel's customer is group tours who are most of the time going out on guided tours during the day so they dont need to take care much. And we are poor independent travelers, paying much higher room rate but hanging around the hotel all day long so the hotel is very tiring to take care of us !!!!"
overnight stay,Date of stay: July 2018,20,"really very average, suit downgrade domestic market at best. Photos look good but place is just 'missing it'. We felt it was expensive once there. We were less than happy. Staff were helpful and were very busy. we were very glad to move on."
Really bad option,Date of stay: August 2018,10,"This hotel it’s a complete disaster, doesn’t deserve three stars. Starting from the reception desk totally luck of organization, besides we have a reservation of a king size room they provide twin beds, no further explanation. Reception lobby sucks. Rooms are small, dirty and sticky. TV is not working. Swimming pool doesn’t have towels or person in duty. I won’t recommend it."
Comfortable. Affordable.,Date of stay: August 2018,30,"Check-in was a breeze with the help of fast, efficient & helpful reception staff. Rooms were mid-sized. Views differ though, depending on where you are facing. Beds were comfy & clean. Towels were fluffy. Wi-fi was decent. There are times, though, when it works on a snail's pace. Breakfast is ... !! Lets put it this way, the only dishes I could say I was satisfied with were the sweet watermelons and the french fries. Other than that, better to just buy bread from outside & enjoy it in your room with coffee. It can get pretty crowded during summer peak season. Location is good since its a few metres away from Dhoby Ghaut station."
Just not worth your money,Date of stay: July 2018,20,"I dont have a problem with the room at all, its your normal 3 stars hotel type of room. Other than room however, starting from the hallway. Me and my parents were given 2 separate rooms with different floors but this is not the main problem. I dont know what happened with the 7th floor but it smells ginger on the hallway starting from the lift to everywhere. However, when i visit the 8th apparently no ginger smells. My concern is why do this hotel needs to put different air freshener if the ginger is from the sprays, if its not the freshener pls change it! Its not very comfortable. Next is their receptionist, they took very long to process a check in, i wait for about 15-20 mins even though only got 1 person in front of me. And after its my turn, i understand why it takes so long. It was trainee who handles everything and i think he is from china mainland who is not really fluent with english. The trainee also needs to ask their supervisor for about everything which takes them so long. Next thing is the housekeeping, i was asking for extra pillow on about 9pm. Apprently their housekeeping is closed and they cant give me the extra pillow. I stayed in few hotels and usually their receptionist and other services are open 24hours.  Wont coming back here unless they have fix it or have a really significant promo"
Affordable hotel in Orchard,Date of stay: July 2018,40,"Not fancy and quite an old hotel but I 4-night stay here went well.  Its in Orchard... So Location is great! Just 2 minutes walk to/from Somerset. Room I had is not as big as other hotels in Orchard but all you need is available here.  Free wifi, clean rooms, and what I like the most is the in-room water dispenser! Saved money from buying bottled water everyday! Haha  I can stay here again :-)"
Works only for the sleepover,Date of stay: July 2018,20,"With a really bad breakfeast, bad/no wi-fi, no houseclaning the Chancellor only gets the two stars for an ok pool area and ok rooms. But thats it - if you are planning for spending time on the hotel besides the sleeping part: keep searching, there must be better alternatives."
Tourist hotel close to orchard road.,Date of stay: July 2018,40,"Tourist hotel so lots of people hanging about in foyer waiting for transport. Very close to Orchard road (2 minutes). Close to MRT about 7 minute walk. Surprised by rooms quite adequate for stop over visit. Clean, hot water dispenser, bit noisy from road. Couple of negatives girls want to clean rooms early put up do not disturb sign. Shower curtain not really appropriate keeps unhooking. Huge overhead shower head lovely. Desk staff harassed but helpful. Paid extra for a late 6pm check out. Has luggage holding area while yoy wait for transport. Would stay again...out most of time shopping, sightseeing, basic hotel but adequate."
Good location in orchard,Date of stay: June 2018,30,Good location in Orchard and lot's of shops nearby. Our room was nice that we expect and our stay was nice. Only 1 deception on our check in with the Manager: He was very rude and had bad manners to talk with his guest as we ask an early check in as we travel with our daughter of 3 years old. This discourage us on our 1st day on arrival on this hotel. He should learn more in Tourism industry how to welcome people that's very important. But overall of our stay was comfortable and nice.
Family Hoilday,Date of stay: July 2018,30,Is in great location. We had 2 rooms as traveling with family of 4 rooms are small but we didn't care about that as we wer hardly in our room . Has a roof top swimming pool great for cooling off but not the perfect place to relax to noise with all the air conditioning units . And also our room from 2 clock to 5.30 u have a night club that you can hear with heavy music . But could not hear in kids rooms . They did offer to change us but we just sucked it up . It's a good hotel for the price and it's a 3 star
Travelled with 2 adults and toddler - was good,Date of stay: June 2018,40,"Firstly, this is a good hotel but nothing special. It feels budget but in a great location. Porter was fantastic on both arrival and leaving. Checking in was fine and I needed to pay full stay. Checkout was very slow as they couldn't find my paperwork. The taxi was called, loaded and waiting for 10 minutes until she just let me go after I told her everything was paid for. I also waited for quite a while behind someone who also had check in issues when there were other staff around. Only 1 serving checkout and checkin.  The hotel has quite a large amount of tour groups. Each morning there would be 5 coaches ready to be loaded up.  The first night we arrived I found the traffic noise quite loud and the neighbours next door could be easily heard. I asked if I could move rooms but they were fully booked. The next morning I opened the curtain to a great view of gardens and the highway noise didn't seem so bad - I got used to it and the loud motorbikes seemed to be only around on that first night.  The rooms are very small but was fine with 2 adults and a toddler in a double and 1 single bed configuration. My feet were off the end of the bed and the mattresses were average.  House Keeping were very good.  We turned off the hot water dispenser each night as it was too noisy. Room air con was set at 24 when you left the room and could be adjusted to no less than 22 degrees when in the room which was fine.  Laundry is outside and right next to where staff smoke. $6 to wash and $6 to dry.  The best part was the Hawker food outside which was brilliant. There was even a Western Stand so we could get some corn, carrots and broccoli for my 3 year old.  Really great location. Could walk to the red line and circle line with ease. Cold Storage supermarket was close too.  Would I come back? Probably not - I would spend more and get a better room somewhere. But this suited us for 6 nights before we went to Sentosa for 4 nights."
very close to orchard road,Date of stay: June 2018,30,"very close to orchard road, small hawkers corner nearby, excellent availability of transport. small rooms and a very limited food menu. a number of bars and entertainment in the area. not the place to stay if you want to spend a lot of time in the hotel. helpful and friendly staff."
"VERY BAD HOTEL ,NOT RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE. THEY SHOULD CLOSE DOWN THE PROPERTY",Date of stay: May 2018,10,"1. Smelly Rooms: We has been informing this from the start that there is a stinking smell within the rooms which should have been acted upon.  2. Non street Facing rooms ; Wall Facing rooms: Selecting premier rooms at-least client should have got the street view / city view rooms which could have reduced the level of HIT we took in order to select the same !  3. No Tissues in Room: We called up the reception, asking for tissues to be sent to the room (two rooms out of 6), but after one and a half hour those were sent. This is the level of hospitality which we had to face.  4. Rude Staff at Reception: We even went to reception to complain thrice or four times, who wouldn't speak up or revert to us regarding our issues."
A Good Place to Stay,Date of stay: June 2018,50,"I'm stay at this hotel for my business trip and i think it was a good hotel... The location is near to orchard road so it was very strategic hotel.. The lobby quite big, they have limited receiption so if the guest was many we must patient until we can check in there... The room wqs quite big and quite complete with refrigerator and water dispenser.. The toilet quite good also... I think this hotel very recomended for the people if they want to stay near to orchard road.."
Good location,Date of stay: May 2018,30,"We stayed at Chancellor for 3 nights in May 2018. The hotel is located in the orchard road and it is very convenient to travel any ware MRT is near and the BUS stop is also next to it, Taxi stand just in front of the hotel . The hotel is very crowded specially in the lobby area most of the guest are Indians and can be so noisy some time. The rooms are convenient and clean the city view was amazing. food is average. You can find may food courts near the area.  Can recommend as a good mid-range, travel friendly hotel ."
Best location but average property,Date of stay: June 2018,30,"Location of the property is best. It is right on orchard road and all famous malls are within walkable area. Even the MRT station (Dhoby Ghat, if one wants to visit little India) and Somerset MRT (for Singapore Zoo) are just 10-minutes walk. Bus/ taxi are easily available outside the hotel.  My experience with staff (especially the lady at the reception) was good, quite accommodating and helpful.  Breakfast has very limited options for vegetarian.  Property may seem to be over-priced, considering the price they charge. In other words, one is paying higher price for location.  So, if you are looking for a hotel at orchard road, but are on budget, you can consider this. Other nearby hotels are concorde hotel and holiday inn, but these may be more expensive."
Good stay but rude behavior of staff at breakfast area.,Date of stay: June 2018,30,"Good small, equipped rooms and the best part was water dispenser. View from hotel room 827 was just superb.  Coming to breakfast section, the cafe was located at 2nd floor and timing was 7AM-10AM, and on entering at 9.40 AM we were told that it would get closed by 10 AM. But isn't it right to allow people continue eating who have entered well before 10. To our surprise guests including me were asked to move out exactly at 10 while we were having Breakfast. It was very rude beahviour of staff.  Otherwise hotel is nice, with 5 min walk to DHOBI GHAUT MRT and shops/malls nearby.  Visited in june 2018 with family."
Not too bad...,Date of stay: June 2018,20,"The room was pretty good, despite other comments, it was reasonably sized compared to some we stayed in throughout Europe. Bathroom was fine although a bit cramped in the shower over the bath. Breakfast was complimentary but a total disaster and not worth the effort. Lobby was terrible but Chinese restaurant well worth a visit."
The staff’s attitude were super bad,Date of stay: June 2018,20,"I always trust that SG would be a country of 5 star service until I came to this hotel. All of the receptionists were too cold and rigid for nothing. The key cards were unable to use and no one even said sorry. Lobby always too crowded and no one even tried to manage anything, including the duty manager. Sure thing Chancellor located on a nice are, easy to go shopping and such. But that’s it."
BAD EXPERIENCE OF HOTEL IN SINGAPORE,Date of stay: June 2018,30,"Room service very poor if you ask for anything the will bring after 4-5 reminders and after an hour, breakfast was worst and hotel staff was not ready to serve even they count for sugar packets. Only positive is best area of singapore"
It's and OkOk hotel,Date of stay: August 2017,30,Had been hyped to be one of the good budget hotel but little disappointed staff had poor attitude markings like why and what should we do care check in time are strict bit nice they arrange early checkin
Diappointed .. poor service,Date of stay: June 2018,10,"Checked in at 6am only to discover booking had been cancelled as a know show.. We booked through booking.com and advised by email that we would be arriving the next morning after the date booked because of the early flight time arrival. Booking .com relied by email that they had advised hotel. Hotel said they had no record and were not interested when I tried to show them the email response confirming our arrival time. Had to wait for them to find a room after a 13 hour flight! Room was not very clean. No second pillows available as told they had a full house! Asked room service for toast and got warm bread! Did not understand what I was asking for!  We stayed here two years ago and the standard has gone down since then, will not be staying again."
good hotel,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Nice place and very closed with MRT easy to go anywhere and good very clean with nice staff thank you for good holiday and i am sure will back again in July 2018 and see you very sooon thank you so much.
"Disappointed in ""Don't care"" attitude",Date of stay: June 2018,20,"Arrived with family youngest at 6, at 8pm. One of family didn't travel in the end, so staff decided to change booking (that was already paid for....) to a smaller room and then also took breakfast option off as well. All paid for in advance. When challenged were told to take it up with travel agent!!! We woke up one morning to no hot water.... Were told it is being looked at. 10 hours later, still no hot water. We requested another room access to shower, but were not able to be accommodated... Staff were not in the least bit friendly, never smiled and were basically rude the whole stay of 8 days. Overall a disappointing experience and would never go back to this place. I would pay the extra and find somewhere a little nicer. Staff need a lesson on being polite and customer service."
Nice hotel.,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Stayed for few days and good place for family visit. All basic amenities present. Breakfast was excellent and centrally located to get taxi or bus service anytime. Food was expensive but surrounding places have decent eating places and cafeteria.
Chancellor @ Orchard,Date of stay: April 2018,30,"The Hotel is centrally located, As told by many the bathrooms are small. The staff needs to be more courteous. When asked for a glass of drinking water when I was around the restaurant, the staff said "" We dont give water here, buy a bottle & drink"" I was a bit taken aback when I heard this. Customer centric attitude is lacking. The breakfast didnt have much options & seems to be dumped around rather than being arranged. Good hotel but needs little more customer centric appoach"
"Functional, basic and clean.",Date of stay: April 2018,30,"This is really well located hotel, ideal for stopovers during long haul flights/travel. While efficient, the front desk/ reception area has nothing to offer but check in, check out and concierge service. No sitting about here having a drink or “people watching”! There’s a little convenience shop in the corner of the lobby that has souvenirs, snacks and toiletries, that’s about it! It is within a stone’s throw of the major shopping malls and streets. For weary travellers, our room was spotless and very comfortable and the price was right too!"
"Location, location",Date of stay: June 2018,30,"The only plus is location, room and bathroom small but then so is the price. I guess you get what you paid for. Breakfast was not included but went there on a rainy morning. Expensive about $27 incl surcharge, had 1 boiled egg and didn’t finish coffee. The plus is Orchard Central is a few mins walk so had breakfast there every other day for $8average. We booked a deluxe room (double bed) but on arrival was upgraded to premium (twin) to our delight, reason it’s on the highest floor but thinking about it, is it because two men can’t share a double? Better on two twin beds?. The single bed was the smallest I’ve ever seen in my life, like a prison bunk. Anyway, we tell ourselves it’s only 4 nights and to Be positive about it. It’s a family hotel and noisy. The hotel guests were mainly Indians and Filipinos. So all you could hear is the shuffle and noise between rooms. Downstairs foyer everyday is like an airport lounge, all waiting to go on tours. The plus is the discovery of the Chinese restaurant (Peranakan) that is cheap serving Nonya food. The best Beef Rendang I’ve eaten in my life."
Not bad like some comments do.,Date of stay: June 2018,40,I stayed here for 7 days which is including extending the stay twice. The room is a bit small and the bathroom too but it does the job. It was clean. Had everything I wanted and was close to the city. Recommend to people. Helpful staff.
Good price and location,Date of stay: May 2018,30,Pros- unlimited drinking water provided Cons- •shower area too small •Breakfast was same for all 5 days (might be providing same food every morning just after warming it up) •Nothing For Vegetarians- only fruits and bread •No early checkin
Hotel Chancellor Singapore had better days...,Date of stay: May 2018,20,"Location a plus - Orchard Street, public transport etc. And this was the only ""plus""... Hotel Chancellor had better days.... Average rooms that can do with maintenance and better cleaning. Breakfast in this hotel is totally not worth it! You can get far better at the 7Eleven around the corner or at the foodmall at Orchard Plaza."
LOCATION IS VERY GOOD,Date of stay: May 2018,30,yes its an average hotel with all facilities like swimming pool breakfast room service etc  rooms are not too big  but are clean  we have given triple bed for couple & 2 kids so that was good  will recommend to others
Rude duty manager,Date of stay: March 2018,20,"I was early for check in. The duty manager Mr.Shahulhammed informed me that there are no vacant rooms which is understandable. But inspite of sitting right in front of him as he alloted rooms to other guests, when I questioned him he showed me the time and said there's still 15min left and he can only call up housekeeping after that..finally I got the room 1 hour late.Pathetic behaviour."
Old but at heart of everything,Date of stay: April 2018,50,"Room is not much to write home about. About 25sqm. Feels really old but they serve as awesome breakfast. Staff is accommodating even dead of night. Best part, you're right at the doorstep of criss crossing MRTs and bus lines. You'll get to wherever you need to go fast.  For the hornballs among you... There's a girlie bar right behind the hotel with Filipin types. So don't take your family out back unless you want them to see gals in their jiggly bits"
worst customer staffs,Date of stay: April 2018,10,"I paid for a premium , 1 queen bed room but was assigned to 2 twins bed. Room was very small, bath tub is horrible, you need to lift your feet high in order to get in and the area is very compact. always bumped myself into the shower glass or wall. Carpet in the room is very dirty. Always lot of people in the lobby waiting for their tours and loud talking inside the hotel area. e.g. elevator. I stayed there on 04/23 thru the 25th of April. Over price but dirty and noisy hotel"
Smelly Hotel,Date of stay: April 2018,10,"Even though this hotel is rated as 3 stars, I doubt it. Besides being so smelly and with unpleasantly dirty ares.  There is no amenities in the room. Not even a tooth brush or tooth paste.  What they had is only a soap for 2 people for the entire stay !!!!!!!! one shower cap for 2 people and one sanitary bag.  For shampoo and body wash comes in a container with stating NO REFILL.  Check in time slow: be ready to wake at least 30 mins to check in even you are dead tired after long hours flight.  Breakfast got variety but quality none. The waiter checking for room number totally overlook me as foreigner and ask me to wait and he attended the asians. The breakfast area is not taken care of well. as shown in attached photos below.  Stay at this hotel if you are happy with smelly rooms and corridors. Singapore streets are cleaner than this hotel !"
"Too much is bad, so don't go there",Date of stay: April 2018,10,"We have just returned from a holiday, where we have experienced the best and worst of Hotels in Asia. We cruised to Singapore on Princess and had booked an overnight stay in the Hotel Chancellor@Orchard, before journeying on to our next destination in Hoi An, Vietnam. After 7 days we travelled back to the Chancellor@Orchard, for three nights before returning home. Our first experience here should have forewarned us. We arrived at about 8pm and asked about Dinner in either a café or restaurant in the hotel. The Desk clerk told us the Bistro was open until 10pm, but last orders were taken a half hour prior to closing time. As we took the lift we saw an advert which confirmed the time. After an introduction to our rooms, we went to the Bistro at 8:50pm. It was locked up tight with no sign of life so maybe had not opened. That night after going to a local food hall, we settled down for the night. As we drew the bathroom door it squealed loudly on its track. We tried to make a cup of tea from the hot water dispenser. Only lukewarm water, but also for room temperature and chilled water, it was the same. The safe in the room was locked so we couldn’t store our valuables. I switched the TV on to try for the Games and found no channels, except one and that was so bad the screen jumped around with no sound. Next morning, we went to breakfast, that which we had pre-paid for. It was mostly Asian, but there was enough selection to be adequate. After breakfast we went to inform the desk clerk of the defects in our room. The duty manager arranged for a service person and himself to attend to the defects. The result was that the TV was left working, the safe was unlocked, to be useable. The hot water dispenser was adjusted, so we could get boiling water, although the cold water remained lukewarm, too hot to drink. Although the bathroom door was supposed to have been mended, it squealed louder than before. Our worst experience occurred at breakfast on the next morning. We approached the door and as before was asked for our room number. The guy asking looked on a document, turned tail and left a young assistant to look again, he had no idea what he was looking at and asked for help from an older assistant. He dismissed the younger boy and started looking, but then he stated that our daughter who was from the adjoining room had breakfast, but we hadn’t paid for ours. I challenged that and told him to call the Reception to check. He instructed us to step to one side whilst paying guests could make their way past us. Several passed, and he could see I was getting quite irritated. So, he told me to sit down whilst they continued checking. I said, I only want my breakfast, I don’t want to sit down whilst I’m treated as a thief. He then walked away, and another man came to us. I told him the problem and he told us to go and get breakfast whilst he checked. Five minutes later he came to our table and told us only one of two rooms had paid for breakfast. I told him to go away as we were about to go to see the duty manager. A few minutes later we went to reception, and the clerk who booked us in confirmed to the duty manager that we had paid for all our breakfasts. I complained about the severe embarrassment at being detained and treated as a group of thieves."
Not as expected,Date of stay: April 2018,30,"Shocking ...!!!! Room no lock 😱  Not sure if this is the first time room being let out or other customers are being easy..  First day arrived told the counter for twin room, was told there is 1 available Wen gotten key up to room, it’s queen bed 😲 Then gotta go down lobby tell to another gal n got it changed  Wat a hassle.."
"Decent Hotel, Great Location !",Date of stay: January 2018,40,"Must say that going from India, we were little disappointed with the size of the room and beds, but the location and the view from the hotel makes up for it. orchard road is one of the most posh areas in Singapore and if you wanna shop brands, this is the place. The hotel definitely has a great neighbourhood, so whether you wanna go shopping, or head for a fine dine restaurant or even take your pick on the singapore street food, everything is in the close vicinity. The hotel itself minus the room size is pretty good. Loved the hospitality and cleanliness. The breakfast that we had at the hotel was also great. If you are looking at a budget hotel which is decent enough to stay and offers a great location do not think twice. This hotel is just perfect"
"Perfect Hotel (Location, Food, Grocery) !!!!",Date of stay: May 2017,40,"Excellent Location to have the hotel with following advantages:  Very nice and courteous staff, there is general store inside the hotel lobby, well maintained rooms (a bit small but as per me we just need to sleeping at night rest all days you will be out for business or vacation). You can easily get the Taxi for going anywhere in Singapore, Good thing is that UBER is there in SINGAPORE, so advice to take local SIM Card and book UBER as per your convenience.  1. Multiple Cuisines Hotel right opp. to hotel, you can say street side hotel (do try TEA (pronounce as TE-OH in Singapore), well maintained Indian, Chinese, Singapore Cuisine restaurant. 2. General stores for all daily needs, you can even get local SIM card from owner in much reasonable rate, I got for 15 SGD with ample talk and data time. 3. ORCHARD ROAD, just 5 mins walk and you will be on ORCHARD road, where multiple malls and many many option for food and shopping options are there. IT IS FAMOUS for SHOPPING. 4. Somerset metro station from where you can go anywhere in singapore for attractions visit like (Singapore Flyer, Garden by the bay, Sands by the bay etc) in 10 SGD."
Nice hotel !,Date of stay: August 2017,40,A very nice hotel in singapore...located at the most popular tourist attraction Orchard road ...major tourist attraction r nearby from this hotel...room was clean and staff is also good..rooms r available in budget so not much costly...breakfast was good..area is very posh.....generally group tourists stay here much....overall a nice hotel....give it a try .....enjoy ur stay...!
"Avoid, avoid, avoid...",Date of stay: March 2018,30,"...unless you are travelling in a huge group and don‘t mind being surrounded by dodgy KTV bars and massage shops.  Rooms are ok for 3 star level, but hotel is noisy (loud people on corridor) and crowded by group traveller.  Probably was the only business traveller in that hotel."
"Excellent location, Rooms are small, Breakfast is disappointing",Date of stay: March 2018,30,"We stayed in Chancellor during our Singapore holiday and the hotel has the best location in terms of connectivity and proximity to the metro. Getting around in sgp should definitely be done using the MRT, you can get a card at the airport itself and the system is brilliantly connected to all of Singapore. The hotel itself is clean and neat and hous keeping is very efficient. They are pretty helpful too. However we were very disappointed with the breakfast service and ended up eating out on most days since it was pretty bad. Cold sausages, semi raw eggs, a weird corn in milk kind of thing, fruits were decent but not too many. Also croissants and danish but they were strictly ok, better to head out instead. The rooms are small but are pretty well organised and mostly you only go there to crash, so it doesn’t really matter. If you want a bathtub you may need to book a premier room ... ours just had a tiny shower.  Tl;dr Clean but small rooms, give breakfast a miss. Worth booking for the location."
Not suitable for Business traveller,Date of stay: February 2018,10,"Extremely poor quality rooms - even premier room is like a room in a small INN / Guest house. Not value for money. Staff good. Location very good. Not fit for business traveller as bus loads of tourist occupies most of the areas of hotel - noisy - no conceirge service to take bags to room !! in a nut shell not value for money, should charge half."
Singapore Hotel of note,Date of stay: February 2018,40,"This hotel is right in the middle of the shopping district of Orchard road. The staff are friendly and very willing to help even at 1 Oclock in the morning. Room was clean with good Wifi (free) and serviced every day. Unfortunately the hot/cold water dispenser was not working correctly and they didn't manage to fix it during our 3 day stay. A varied breakfast which was included in our room price was reasonable but such things as bacon and meat sausages, except chicken, not available. Service was fast and friendly.We would stay there again ."
Location Is good but not much else,Date of stay: August 2017,20,"Hotel is well situated near malls and transport routes but that's about it. The rooms are tiny, decent for a couple at most not family. There are 2 elevators which are constantly full with no other option from getting to and from the room."
Hotel Chancellor - Stay elsewhere,Date of stay: February 2018,10,"Stayed for 1 week. Room was small but clean and tidy. Negatives- reception staff were slow and didn’t really care if you are there or not, breakfast was the same food every day and it was cold and bland when complained about all the food was cold the response was “I’m not the cook”. No pay Tv only normal channels that are less than average to watch and reception was poor. Location was near taxi rank and bus stops and shops , the only issue is that Orchard Road is where all the designer labels are so if your shopping for bargains do not stay at Orchard rd. I would definitely NOT stay at this hotel again and after traveling all over Singapore I would recommend Sentosa Island the place to stay."
Location is Amazing very good property,Date of stay: March 2017,40,Stay in this hotel the best part is the location everything is walking distance just 200 meters away you get little india and mustafa market hotel is really clean and good rooms are average spacious if you go for higher room you get good view of the city breakfast was good and would recommend for indian traveler
Location Is Good If You Can Stomach The Rest!!!,Date of stay: February 2018,10,"Booked these premises through Agoda.com., where the pictures like on many other booking engines were better looking than the reality. But when you know this, you always leave a little room for disappointment. At arrival everything seemed fine, we were even warned that everything was to Asian size. Weird, but they seemed to have the need to mention it, specially in regards to the beds. Although the beds and the location are the only positive thing I can comment on. Even at present I am waiting for housekeeping to come and deal with the ants crawling on, around and in the toilet bowl. It has been half an hour even after 2 phone calls. Not to mention, that these are so called upgraded rooms. I wonder if the upgrade refers to the small foyer that we have with a main door leading to the rooms? The first morning the reception was so crowded, that we left it to the evening to comment on the things that were not done or missing in our rooms. In the evening 2 of us ladies bought ice cream and walked back to the hotel eating them. Upon arrival in the drive way, while we were having a conversation amongst us, we were spoken to by the porters. One of them saying”cooling off your body with ice cream?” It may have not been a line to chat us up, but it irked me nevertheless to be spoken to in this way, as they don’t do this when you are in male company. I couldn’t help but saying, “ no I usually cool down with cold water, maybe you should try it yourself”. Then we go to the reception to complain about the absolutely filthy windows in one of the rooms, and the long black hair in the folded towels. They made a big issue of reassuring us that it would be dealt with in the morning. My friend mentioned that the bathrobes were indeed Asian size and that it was difficult to use them to go to the pool area in them. Upon which the young man replied laughingly “ I will check with the vendor. But you would look sexy in the small one”. We were so perplexed, that we didn’t have a comeback to that. And we are by all means not fallen on our mouths. Needless to say, that the windows are still filthy, the bathrobes to small and the towels still contain long black hair. The pool on the roof top is not tended to. The sun beds, chairs and tables in pityful condition. The pool seems to be clean, but how can it not be with so much chlorine. All in all, in a city with plenty of hotels in the same price range, do not book this one. Orchard Road is a good location, but we have noticed that the public transport and taxis are very cheap. So there is no need to be right in the middle of it, when the longest driving distance is about 15 minutes. Taxis are really really cheap. And I repeat, there is public transport to everywhere."
"Horrible hotel, don’t stay here",Date of stay: February 2018,10,"Room are very smelly, toilet smell are all over the room as no ventilation. Poor bathroom amenities, provide one cheap shampoo for both hair and body and non-refillable, no one utilize this cheap shampoo, don’t understand why they have to emphasize ‘non-refillable’ it makes their service even cheaper. All staffs wear unfriendly faces and no respect to the guests. Food and beverages are very poor too, breakfast with only starch with no meat, no vegetables. Swimming pool without any service or amenities, look very boring and not clean. This is the worst hotel we’ve ever stayed. HORRIBLE!!!"
Location,Date of stay: February 2018,40,"I didnt encounter any problem with my check in and check out. But my only concern is the staffs there especially those working at the counter , please train them on how to entertain guest . Customer service damn bad . Anyway i love the location its close to everything in orchard road . To house keeper , i put do not disturb so please do not enter the room and changed the towel ."
Litigation on the horizion. Do not stay there,Date of stay: February 2018,10,"This place is a standard Singapore 3* with nothing remarkable about it except it price during the airshow week (my fault - I booked at the last minute.  The hotel was recently taken over, renamed and refurbished. So the rooms are in good condition and the pool is nice. The breakfast buffet is OK but no more than that.  The internet is fast, sheets are cleen and the water is hot.  So why the one circle? Because to climb in and out of the tiny bath in order to shower involves swinging around the glass partition and praying you dont slip (especially getting out of a wet bath). There is no way this bathroom meets health and safety standards. I mentioned this to the manager when I was checking out. She said that she was aware of the problem.  I will not be staying there again unless the bathrooms are fixed. I stayed in room 1008.  Under n"
"Awful, terrible service, the worst hotel you may find. Even a dormitory would be too nice a word to describe this",Date of stay: February 2018,10,"The personnel is really ill mannered, the breakfast is beyond awful! I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. The ‘greeter’ for breakfast does not even have a smile nor does she even greet. She’s very rude and impolite. I wonder how this is called a hotel"
The reception lost my simcard,Date of stay: January 2018,10,"Very bad service, i visit the hotel at 26 27 28 january ( 3 days) room 415. When i come back to VietNam. i send a sim card and an MRT card to my friend and put it into an envelope, give it to Mrs Jane Royo at the reception, So my friend can come and pick up this week. She open the envelope and she lost my sim card. After that she put the MRT card into another envelope. The text in the photo below is not my text and is written by Mrs Jane Royo"
Just about average - just location !,Date of stay: January 2018,30,"Well, I have read reviews of many travelers on the hotel and I don't have highly tangential opinion either. We stayed for 4 nights and since were were on a tight schedule we somehow survived it. I agree Singapore is expensive and space is a premium - but the rooms are so small that you cannot stay with a family (we had 2 small kids - 8 & 4) with 3 beds. We managed to squeeze.  The reception can be super busy with 100s of tourists waiting for transfers or check-in. Please expect to be invited by a disinterested receptionist (probably overworked I must say!). One thing I appreciate that they allowed us with an early checkin and that was a life saver given that we had travelled all the way from Hyderabad for this super quick tour.  The room was super small, but had a water dispenser - which was a life-saver for us. The bathrooms were hyper small and the shower area was hard to negotiate too. Nevertheless - had the minimalist stuff (shampoo + body wash mix?)  The breakfast area was unclean - simply because it was super crowded by tourists and the tables were unclean and unkept (the housekeeping simply could not keep up). The food was below average - though they did try to attempt to make things available for vegetarians. If you are a vegetarian - expect to just manage to eat some bread slices.  Go to this place only if you wish to stay near the Orchard road and get some shopping done. Unfortunately, I had booked this through an agent who planned out my schedule. Wish I had taken places from Airbnb as my other friends recommended."
Location only!,Date of stay: August 2017,20,Great location. But breakfast buffet was not up t the standards. No variety. We stayed there for 5 nights and everyday they offered the same. Plates were not washed properly. Service staff in the restaurant were very rude. Cannot recommend.
Staff unwelcoming and unhelpful,Date of stay: January 2018,20,We arrived from UK at 6.30 am following a long flight. We were greeted by a disinterested receptionist who was not prepared to register us. When we found the right person it was easy to organise storing our luggage and we could go sightseeing. The staff on duty later were more helpful but really training is needed to make this hotel one to recommend. We were asked to sign for a very mediocre expensive breakfast half way through and the room was only ok. The bed was hard so we asked for a topper. This blanket was thrown at us by a poorly trained member of the housekeeping team. The towels fortunately arrived minutes before my shower. The shower gel in the dispenser had not been replaced so I had to have a shower without. Surprisingly only 1 teabag per person per day is provided free. The disinterested receptionist seemed oblivious to the ludicrous nature of this rule but did organise one more teabag each for a second cuppa! The reason this is 2 star is the swimming pool which is excellent. It’s clean and 28m is pretty good.
"Dirty hotel, incompetent staff. Worst Hotel I have ever stayed at. Stay Away!",Date of stay: January 2018,10,"I have never stayed at a worst hotel than this. Let me go through my pain over 5 nights between the 17th and 22nd January. I booked two rooms and am a family of five which includes three kids aged 14, 12 and 9. They were going to put us on separate floors! After pointing this out, they were able to get us the two rooms about 3 doors away from each other. After checking in we found black mound throughout one of the bathrooms and bathtub. It hasn’t been cleaned for a long while.We made a complaint and it took them 2 days to move us (my wife has pictures of this). On two separate days I went to the toilets on ground floor which are used frequently by the guests, I found there was no soap in the dispensers - even after bringing this to the attention of the Assistant Manager on the first day they didn’t even bother to refill it - can you imagine how unsanitary this is? You have people using the toilet, not washing their hands with soap and then touching doors and elevator buttons? They didn’t even care. The ground floor toilet was also filled with sewer flies which are caused by dirty pipes ie the flies lay their eggs in the pipes below the bathroom floor and eat the assorted gunk that are in the pipes, they then lay their eggs in the pipes before hatching and flying up through the bathroom floor grate.(I have video evidence of this and the two days without soap) The foyer is constantly filled with tour groups so it’s always noisy and you have to wait to see the staff at reception and you can never get a seat if waiting. The rooms are very basic and only have one small side table to put your stuff. Garbage / used diahes that were placed outside the rooms and on top of the bins outside the elevators were not picked up for two days. There was no pressure in the showers as they use a cheap shower head. You don’t get separate shampoo and conditioner, but rather an all in one cheap and nasty liquid through a dirty dispenser above the bath tub. The breakfast - the worst I have ever encountered. Basic and the noodles were so smelly that my kids left the table and sat at another table on the opposite side of the room beavuse they couldn’t stand the smell of the breakfast. We did not eat breakfast for the other 4 days. The Assistant Manager John Chew - he is incompetent and lied to me about discussing my feedback about the dirty bathroom, mould and smelly breakfast with the Hotel’s Manager when he hadn’t. He deliberately held off telling me until the morning I was leaving that the hotel would not compensate me for the above. They offered me a late checkout even though I told him all I wanted to do from my first night was to get out their dirty hotel, not stay longer! They also offered me a transfer to the Airport, even though they were aware that I already had a transfer organised. The pool: this is on the top floor. If you would like to relax by the pool I suggest you bring some noise cancelling headphones with you as you will be sitting next to twenty air conditioning units blasting noise behind your cheap plastic lounge chairs. After demanding to see the Hotel Manager, I met Danny Koh about half an hour before I was due to leave on my transfer to the Airport. He agreed to refund me a night’s accomodation and shook my hand on it. More lies, as I have just received an email from him stating that as I booked through an Agent, he was “having a hard time” refunding the one night’s accomodation which he had no intention of doing in the first place. This whole situation put a dampener on our stay in Singapore. Do yourself a favour and avoid this dump, even if it is a cheaper option, you still want a certain standard. I will be forwarding my photos and videos to the relevant Health Authorities in Singapore as this hotel is not fit to function."
Absolutely atrocious,Date of stay: January 2018,10,we stayed 5 nights at this hotel a family of 5 ( 3 kids ) on check in couldn't get rooms on same floor despite request for interconnecting rooms . Eventually they gave us 2 rooms same floor but at opposite ends of the hotel so we had to divide and conquer . My room had mould all around the bathroom and shower curtain and the room was filthy . We paid for breakfast for 5 days at approx $20 per head and the food was inedible buffet style and the coffee machine had a broken frother but you could purchase a cup from bar at $6 a cup . The room access keys kept decoding leaving us lining up in lobby area to get back into our room and the hotel foyer was always crowded with large groups so no where to sit having only 12 chairs in the foyer . The hotel reaked of dampness and a sour smell The best day here was the day of departure if I had to give any PRO it would be location but for the same money you could stay at Holiday Inn which is far superior . When we aired our concerns we had to continually chase a response and it took them 2 days to change us from a mouldy room to a substandard room next door to our other room . I was so disappointed that our amazing holiday ended with this stay .... this hotel was disgraceful and in my opinion should not be in operation . I must say however the porters were helpful and friendly
"Average hotel, but perfect locality",Date of stay: January 2018,30,"Our family of two adults and three young children stayed there in January 2018. We had inter-connecting rooms. The location was perfect as Orchard Road and MRT stations were within walking distance.  The buffet breakfast was average on Asia hotel standards. The room was comfortable and rooms were cleaned daily. We enjoyed the rain drop style shower head. However, both TVs weren't working and required new remote batteries. The free wifi was limited and we had to pay and buy a three day wifi deal.  Another obvious absence was the daily bottled water that many other Asia hotels offer.  While we stayed there we found the hotel 'extremely' busy. Be it morning or evening the hotel lobby was over crowded with tour groups from India, China, South Korea or Indonesia. This meant long queues or just crowded scenes when waiting for transfers etc.  We would, however, stay at this hotel again. It also had a lovely rooftop pool that proved popular with the kids and there was an affordable nearby laundromat."
Good location,Date of stay: January 2018,20,We had three nights at this hotel and got a reasonable rate through an online website. The rooms are small and the one we had did not have views. The package included breakfast. The food generally was not very good for a westener and tended to be aimed at the aisian pallet. I used to work in Singapore and far better Asian food. They took too long refilling the buffet and you had to ask for things that weren't there.On the good side the swimming pool on the roof is excellent
Great location but average hotel room,Date of stay: December 2017,30,Front desk supervisors(Alfonso/Anthony) are good but not the rest support staff. Room is average quality or below average(It is rather new but it has smell . The pool is great on top floor and is not well utilized.
One of the worst hotel experience,Date of stay: December 2017,20,"Paid around $350 for two nights stay with the hotel. Really basic hotel with minimal facilities and amenities with only a very small swimming pool at the roof. Rooms are clean spacious and the tv allows you to connect to YouTube.  Other than that, the breakfast buffet sucks beyond any definable terms. The eggs are soaked in milk and the variety is limited. Not worth paying for the breakfast.  Service provided by the front desk swings both ends. Some of the staff were friendly and helpful but most (including the manager Kim) had really bad service. This includes the room service quality in which we waited for hours for our room to be cleaned but it still wasn’t cleaned when we return at around 8 pm. Disappointing. Had to go down personally to the front desk quite a few times.  All in all, a really bad experience which could have been one off or probably how things work around here. The $350 spent here could put u in a better hotel with quality food and up-to-standard service."
3 nite stay,Date of stay: December 2017,40,"Location is good. 10 minutes strool to either Sommerset / Orchard and Dhouby Ghout / Plaza Singapore. Good staff...reception was thumbs up..though a group just check in and the staff was on his last minute duty, still open and helpfully finished the check in. All well under 10 minute. My arrival was on 07 Dec afternoon at around 4 and stayed in room 1047. Room was ok. B'fast is ok. My wife loved the spring roll but was not serve ob the last 2 days. Will be back again and hope same service is provided and the spring roll available."
"Friendly staff, breakfast, and location",Date of stay: November 2017,50,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a few nights while in Singapore. The hotel has breakfast and is close to Orchard Rd (maybe a 5 minute walk...at most). We were able to check in on arrival (early, at 10am after a long-haul flight). The staff were welcoming and courteous. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  Yes, this hotel appears to cater to groups, but don't hesitate to book. My wife and I encountered a few groups during our stay. The upside of catering to groups is they have a lot of rooms and will likely have a room ready for your arrival! We had a pleasant experience and would stay here again."
Friendly Staff,Date of stay: November 2017,50,The staff at the reception were really helpful despite the fact that ours was a ladt minute booking. We stayed for 4 nights but our key card never worked. We didn't get their breakfast as there's a nearby place where we can eat and the nearest mall is a 5-min walk from the hotel only.
Value for your Money in Orchard Road,Date of stay: December 2017,50,"We had booked a total of 5 rooms in Hotel Chancellor @ The Orchard, and stayed a period of 5 days/nights. The hotel is centrally located at Orchard Road, and is minutes away from the MRT, countless malls and restaurants/food courts! The rooms were neat and clean, with the housekeeping providing you excellent room service. The idea of drinking water dispenser in each room is a gem, since water is expensive in Singapore. The breakfast buffet served on the second floor is quite nice and healthy. They provide a variety of juices, breads, fruits, yogurts, etc. The swimming pool on the rooftop needs to be visited at least once to see the skyline of Singapore.  Good going guys! You definitely have me coming again!!!"
Excellent budget location in Orchard Road!,Date of stay: January 2017,50,"The hotel is centrally located in Orchard Road (which I always stick with whenever I fly to Singapore) and is within short walking distance to 3 metro stations, malls, restaurants and even Starbucks (located right on the other block)! Although the room was small compared to other hotels in the area, the facilities looks new, well-maintained and clean. The hotel was also easy to find since it's only in Kramat Lane area. The breakfast served was the usual oriental one but still delectable.  When we arrived from our early morning flight, the receptionist on duty was really attentive and the service was really excellent. What we won't forget was when they even upgraded us to Premiere Suite instead of our Double Deluxe Room reservation and since our flight was delayed we had no choice but to do an early check-in where the manager was so nice to waive the fees for our pre-blocked room! This gesture was really heartwarming and because of this, we'll surely definitely come back next time!"
One night was enough,Date of stay: November 2017,30,"My first impression on check in was poor, litter around the reception desk, sweetie wrappers, hair clips etc, I wanted to walk out immediately but it was late and we were tired. I was told by the receptionist that our room had a ""nice view"" !! The room was dark , and my ""nice view"" was straight onto the back of another hotel, I would hate to have seen the bad view !!! The room was dated and dark, with very basic amenities, but the bathroom was a horror. The shower cubicle was filthy, hairs and soap scum up the walls, and the shower curtain looked awful. There was a glass door and a glass partition separating the shower from the bedroom, so if anyone needed the bathroom in the night, the bathroom light flooded into the bedroom waking up anyone trying to sleep. The wall mounted water heater took two of us nearly 30 minutes to work out, and we are no good without our morning coffee, so this was infuriating. We had booked with ""booking .com"" and the room rate clearly stated that breakfast was included, a deciding factor when we were choosing a hotel. When I asked about the breakfast, I was told it was not free and there would be a charge, I told him that it was advertised as being included on the website, but he looked very uninterested and told us we would have to pay. We did not try the pool as the filthy bathroom left me questioning their hygiene."
"Basic, well located",Date of stay: November 2017,30,"I would say that this hotel would fall more under the 2* hotel umbrella, however, the location is really good. I would recommend it to people who travel for a couple of nights to Singapore, would like to spend their time visiting the city and do not really want to spend too much time in the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel for extended stays. Rooms are decent, fairly clean, rather on the small side. Breakfast is lacking in terms of variety & quality - pretty dry or tasteless food. Overall, I would say that this is a basic hotel which has a good location in terms of proximity to various attractions and means of transportation."
renovation needed.,Date of stay: November 2017,20,the location of this hotel is perfect. next to orchard road in the center. but the hotel needs a renovation as it's quite old and the rooms are awful and dirty. the bathroom is full of mould. it scared me to touch the shower curtain. The staff at the reception is not special friendly. so no recommendation for this hotel.
Comfortable basic 3 Star Property @Orchard Road,Date of stay: November 2017,40,"I am staying in this 3 star hotel located at Western end of Orchard Road. Located at Cavenagh Road this hotel provides you basic comfort stay at reasonable tariff and offers great location in Singapore particularly gor tourists. I was staying on 7th floor pf the hotel. Check in was fast. Room was of reasonable size with a large window with view of city Greenery. Thete was a comfortable queen sized single bed, writing desk, relaxing sofa at the corner, refrigerator, in room safe in the room. A hot and cold water dispenser in the room was an added bonus. The toilet does not have bath tub, instead have a shower enclosure. Supply of toileteries was below par. At Level 2 of the hotel, the Bistro serves buffet breakfast from 7 to 10 in the morning. You may have lunch or dinner at the same Bistro as well. There is a swimming pool at the rooftop level. Good basic hotel at a value for money for sure."
Not bad,Date of stay: November 2017,30,Location hotel was excellent and has a good view (below picture). Near to shopping centers. Although the room was very small. Wifi was only 100 mb!!!! And low speed Breakfast was so so not bad. But not good.
Good location and great front office service,Date of stay: November 2017,30,"The location of the hotel was really convenient.. All the shopping malls were around the vicinity of the hotel . The front office staff was really kind and professional. There were a few problems , the Wifi had a few glitches as it kept going off every second . The rooms were very small and so was the bathroom. Would like to recommend to have a variety of dishes for breakfast because it looks so plain and dull and it’s basically the same thing everyday."
Handy,Date of stay: November 2017,30,Stayed here for 4 nights. It was right on orchard rd so plenty of shopping right outside door. The room was small but it was fine to sleep in. There was no info book in room which we looked for. The air conditioning was set to 22 which was to hot for us at night. Being from nz thats what we put it on to keep warm.
Excellent,Date of stay: October 2017,40,"The hotel is clean, there's a pool on the rooftop. You get 50 mb of free wifi in the room, but that's not a big deal since you have a smart tv in the room and you can browse the internet from it, or play a video on youtube. The hotel is located very close to Orchard Street where all the malls are. I think the nearest MRT station was Dhoby Ghaut. On the rooftop, there are two pools (one for adults and a shallow one for children). There's also an extraordinary panorama of the city. Near the hotel, there's a corner with street food I used to eat in the evening."
Just OK,Date of stay: November 2017,30,"Only stayed here for one night which was pleasant enough. The two major factors of this hotel is the location, which is a couple of minutes walk to Orchard Road and the many shops and the other is the quite large swimming pool on the roof. My room was quite small and had a bit of a grubby feel to it, especially the carpet. There was a good rain shower in the bath room and the water was nice and hot. The reception area is pretty crowded and noisy with very little seating.The reception staff were just ok. They did not go out of their way at all. Were I visiting Singapore again I would definitely look at alternative hotels."
Good for the price,Date of stay: November 2017,30,"Good rooms/amenities and great location, in relation to the price you pay. The hotel is walking distance from all the big shopping malls on orchard road.  The only hitch was a very rude manager type person when we checked in, which is why I rate it 3 stars (if not 4). The other staff was good and friendly."
Decent hotel with decent services and very good location,Date of stay: October 2017,40,This is a 3 star hotel located very conveniently at a stone's throw away from Orchard Road which is the best shopping district of Singapore. Services are quite decent and reasonable considering the prices. There is an in-house restaurant which server lunch and dinner but I would recommend having food outside. The room service operates from 10 am to 10 pm everyday. Breakfast is free and pretty good. There are a lot of rooms in this hotel and almost anytime you can see a lot of student crowd here coming from neighboring countries. One small problem I noted is that the hotel access cards are not very good and often need reactivation after a few hours - we ourselves got locked out quite a few times as the card was not working. Overall a pretty decent place to stay for a few days.
Budget Hotel,Date of stay: October 2017,30,The location of the hotel is one of the biggest factors worth considering. Located nearby Orchard Road and walk-able distance from Dhoby Gaut MRT Station. The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathroom was also clean but not everyone wishes for a sliding door in their bathroom. The rooftop swimming pool was also clean. The Breakfast buffet was good on some days and average on the other days. Staff is not so helpful. Rest everything was okay. If you're travelling on a budget then this is the best place you can find.
A practical budget hotel in the heart of Orchard Rd,Date of stay: June 2017,30,Hotel nestled built between Somerset & Dhobi Chat MRT very good location .  Ask for rooms facing the Istana room maybe small but wall to wall glass gives it a feeling of space . Room come with high end internet tv even if there is no cable why would you miss it when you can watch movies of the net .  Complementary breakfast can be a war zone with group booking s from India China taking most of the rooms so always full .  Has a great pool gym and a store where you get SIM cards but step out side your on orchard rd with all the malls .
"Good Value, Near the Action of Orchard Road",Date of stay: September 2017,30,"Well located just a block off of Orchard Road, this hotel offers newly renovated, quiet rooms with a lovely view of the city from the upper floors. Patronized by a mostly Malay and Japanese clientele, you won't find very much English spoken in the lobby, while the front staff are attentive and helpful, Housekeeping staff speak Chinese overall and need training on how to relate to customers."
Average but convenient,Date of stay: October 2017,30,"Stopover at S'pore for one night only, and selected this hotel from the travel package. The only pros is the convenience of the location. Other than that, the room is only very average, and not maintained well. Staff are also sub-standard and not very helpful."
Not a good choice,Date of stay: October 2017,10,"We booked this hotel via agoda 5 weeks ago and chose deluxe double room for 3d2N stay, and i added to the requests if we can check in early. They didnt reply at all.  On our stay, We arrived at 12 noon and went to kina, the reception staff. She took a copy of our identifications and said that there are no room available at the time and they can offer it by 3PM. She also said there’s no double room and what she can offer is a twin room and have it fixed together. At the back of my mind, we did our booking ahead of time and they accepted our cash payment, how come when it comes to service, they cannot give an outstanding commitment to their guests - making it our problem now that they cant provide us what we paid for.  So we just went to leave our bags at the concierge and get back by 3PM. When we check in, the receptionist told us that the consumable WIFI is 100MB. (🙄) Then we got out keys and went to our room -504. We were surprised to get TWIN room 😡. I immediately called the reception for this. The lady on the line told me she will get a staff to have the bed be fixed. However, after 10 minutes, nobody came. My husband has no choice but to personally go downstairs and complain. The reception staff told him that they will transfer us to another room tomorrow morning at 7AM. Lets see how they will make up with this mess. My husband came back with a staff - who never knocked on the door and just went it after scanning her door pass. Another 🙄🙄.  So after the staff joined the beds, we discovered that our toiletries were incomplete, there’s no toothbrush, toothpaste - very basic necessity right? I dont know whether thats how the housekeeping works or the room is not 100% ready for occupancy at all. This is a 3 star hotel but their service is as poor as 1star. We’d rather stay in 1-2 star hotel with 5star service! Staff are not polite - not even saying good evening, not hospitable, not smiling, inconsiderate - for having a couple to stay in separate beds.  I will make another feedback if there’s something good to happen with their service. Otherwise, for those who are looking for a place to stay in Orchard, please dont choose this hotel."
Good location and that is it!,Date of stay: September 2017,20,"The hotel is well located to walk around the Orchard road zone by foot. But a part from that, there is nothing good to say about the hotel. The rooms are terribly humid, the lobby turns out everyday into a camping hall, the breakfast room is terrible. Really poor!"
Poor experience,Date of stay: October 2017,10,"Poor experience altogether. From the reception staff very slow, to the room size and cleanliness. They do not clean the room properly every day. It seems like they only do the bad and change the towels. You can get better in singapore for that price."
Good hotel close to Orchard Road,Date of stay: September 2017,40,"In a pricey Singapore, this hotel provides basic comfort at right price. Next to Orchard Road attraction, Dhoby Ghaut/Sommerset MRT and Condrad Hotel Bus stop convenient location. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rebooked the hotel after a satisfying first try."
All is good!,Date of stay: October 2017,40,"If you want a comfy solo place to crash in to do some shopping this is nice. It is located in Orchard with lots of convenient eateries and walking distance to 2 MRTs. But certainly aint good for business traveller cause the wifi in the room isnt very solid and the tv channels are limited. Service was so-so. Some staff knew what to do, some looked lost. Pool is awesome but no towels or guard. Bed is good enough for solo or young couple. Bathroom is tiny but good enough for Asian people. At least the shower is separate from the toilet, unlike some 3* in Singapore where you can knock around or fall over a wet floor. I like the water dispenser the most. And its a non smoking hotel. But I wish the management would upgrade their reception and rooms. Some parts look drab and worn out tho its a new place."
WORST LOBBY EVER,Date of stay: September 2017,10,"We chose this hotel at the first place because of its' location. Super close (walking distance) to Plaza Singapura and Orchard Central. When we arrived at about 12pm, long queue at the receptionist (maybe because lots of people were checking out at the same time). We queued to check in, but then told by the receptionist that we can't check in before 3pm (so there goes our effort to queue). Lobby was super hectic and chaotic, reminds us of a bus terminal with one souvenir store on it. Lots of groups stay here, we saw busses here and there at the entrance. Fortunately, the room was clean (though small). We stayed at Deluxe Triple Room. Unfortunately the shower was really bad. It changed temperature drastically, and the water flow was really small. Not a good experience taking a shower in this hotel."
Rudest staff ever,Date of stay: September 2017,10,"I and my husband stayed at hotel@Chancellor for only 1N/2D. My experience staying in this hotel was very unpleasant. Their staff was unhelpful, disrespectful, and rude (and they can afford to be as they get a lot of group bookings due to their location near orchard road so they don't care).  After waiting for hours in their lobby they offered us twin bed (two seperate beds). On requesting/complaining they kept saying that queen beds are available only if available. Later the staff at desk started talking very rudely and asked for more money if we wanted to have rooms with queen size beds.  They only provide 100MB free wifi per booking transaction,NOT per day. Internet you are given a small amount then you are charged which is not explained to you until you check out and are given the bill.  Definitely recommended to stay away from this hotel at any price."
Good location,Date of stay: September 2017,40,"The location is excellent, nearby Somerset MRT and right in the heart of Orchard Road Shopping spree. Couldn't find a better accommodation. The room was a wee bit small but we're not there all day. Breakfast on level two is okay for $26 per person. Otherwise, you can walk outside along Orchard and eatery is everywhere. We had a triple room which is one queen bed and one single. Pretty good for a family of three. The service is excellent including housekeeping. There is a water filter with unlimited supply which is a real bonus."
DONT STAY HERE,Date of stay: September 2017,10,"By far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I don't think the owner or manager would really care. They still make their money with the bus tours that come through. There is no friendliness , no customer service and the breakfast staff are totally inefficient.The breakfast is very slow to be replenished , and one of the worst breakfasts I have ever come across. Mainly catered for Asians. One egg choice ..which was cold and tasted like rubber . No choice with tea flavour , whatever it was tasted like soapy water . The staff all look totally miserable ..place was full and lacking chairs .Staff so slow to take dirty plates away to enable others to sit down. We tried to use the dining area in the evening.Had an open sign on the door but no one around to serve. front desk stated they were doing room service.Found the Hawkers market a few minutes away and ate there every night for the four nights.The showere was downright dangerous being over a large bath ..could not get out and then started using a hand towel.No non slip mat provided at all. met some Australians going down the lift who had the same complaints. I dont know why they bother having television in the room .NO channels worthwhile Plenty of other hotels in Singapore. I cannot recommend anyone to stay here. It is close to the MRT and close to Orchard road."
Great location,Date of stay: September 2017,40,"I just came back from Singapore for a business trip. Initially, I don't even know where and how the conditions of this hotel. Turns out it located near orchard road, between the two mrt stations, dhoby Ghaut and Somerset. This is the best location I think. Because it really near all the shopping center in orchard. And because of its location between the mrt stations, it was easy for me to go to work. The only flaws I had during my stay was my room location. It was in the far corner of the hotel. And I tell you the hotel is bug and has a lot of room. It was like I walk one more alley. It wasn't convenient for me when I got back to the hotel after a long day at work."
central location and thanks to Mark / Benny,Date of stay: September 2017,40,I have stayed in the hotel for 7 nights ...Hotel's location is good it is very convenient for shoppers as it is in the center of orchard road. Hotel staff is also friendly especially Mark and Benny who work on reception. They helped me for early check in as i had altogether 36 rooms. I appreciate their effort. yes if you are in Singapore for shopping it is the best option for you.
Strategic & convenient in Central Orchard road,Date of stay: September 2017,30,"Location is in prime eastern side of well known Orchard road. Left East side is Presidential palace & Plaza Singapore & right West side is Orchard Central & OG dept stores. Hotel Grand Central seems attached with the hotel. The room is average size for biz travel. Bathroom is small but suitable. Only that TV remote is not available to set the pics & sounds of TV, only cable/satelite TV remote provided & it's only 17 channels available. The two white robes seems used because it's smelly. Probably Housekeeping forgot to change them from previous guests. So the extra pillow in the wardrobe. However, it's worth of the rates from online booking. I think it's the cheapest in Orchard road available."
Just for 3 days not more,Date of stay: August 2017,20,The breakfast menu is poor if you need to stay more than 2 or 3 days. when open the curtains the view in the other hotels windows. at night when go to WC you can not use the lamp of the WC because there is no wall between just a window between the room and WC so you must use it in the dark. The services are different for Chinese & Vietnam is and others they get a better service. The pool in good and big enough. the hotel is in a good location. Free Internet just for 100MB
Average Hotel in Orchard!,Date of stay: August 2017,30,"Location of the hotel is very good. Rooms are average. Bathrooms were clean. Roof top pool area is nice.  Reception staff was good and had a smooth check-in & Check-out. Concierge staff was very helpful and kind. Housekeeping staff was nice & helpful.  Breakfast was horrible. No variety, Limited spread and repetition of same menu for all 7 days. Worst ever scrambled egg & Sausages. We skipped breakfast and ate from restaurants at the basement of Center Point.  Restaurant staff especially the 2 ladies were very rude. Never greet any guests when entering the restaurant. They only ask “Room Number” and that’s it. Generally the 2 ladies are acting as we have entered their restaurant by force to eat food for free.  I guess the dishwasher needs a replacement as most of the plates had dried food particles and the glasses were stained.  Hotel needs to train the entire restaurant staff very soon including the rude cooks who refill the buffet.  Do not recommend for long stay and families with children!"
Never again,Date of stay: August 2017,20,"The hotel looked great from the road and in a great location, after that it wnet down hill. The room was small, tea & coffee facilities were a boiler heater with no instructions on how it works, also very limited tea/coffee to use, 2 each with no milk, only creamer, YUCK.No compendium in the room giving guidance to the city and attractions. The bed was a double one and was like sleeping on a brick, no a brick would have been more comfotable. No other facilities like iron etc. Dont go there."
Very convenient location,Date of stay: August 2017,40,"If you have realistic expectations going in, then you won't be disappointed with this hotel, but if you're expecting Marina Bay Sands, then you will be. The location is really convenient - just off the end of Orchard road, and a short walk to Somerset MRT station (can make it mostly under cover through the arcades if the weather is rainy. Decor is a little tired now, the photos on their website possibly taken a few years ago. Positives are location, price, view (if you get an outwards facing room from a higher floor), pleasant staff (quick to respond to room requests), great free wifi, air-conditioning, hot and cold water urn, bar-fridge, iron and ironing board, safe, roof top pool (note: no bar and closes at 8pm - no towels upstairs), and pretty good cleanliness. Not so positives are no mini-bar, and the room service menu and cafe if you want a snack, lunch or dinner meal. I can't comment on breakfast, as I didn't try it. There are many places to get food nearby and further afield at all times of day though. If looking for a breakfast alternative when a lot of the shops are closed early, then try BreadTalk at 313 Somerset, they open at 7:30 weekdays and 8am weekends. Dinner time, you must try the little satay stand on the corner of Kramat Lane and Cavanagh Road - get the pork belly and a cold Tiger beer and you will be in heaven. Enjoy."
decent hotel location with basic amenities,Date of stay: May 2017,30,"We chose this hotel based on location as we knew we wanted to be out of our room most of the time. It was basic but very central, easy walk to Somerset MRT station which provides lines all around the city and to the main tourist sites. Our room was in a clean but worn state, with a fridge, ""interesting"" water dispencer and safe. The wardrobe was big but only had five hangers - which was fine during out stay I'm sure we could have asked reception for more but we didn't bother. There were small tables at the side of the bed and a small shelf that ran under the TV so not many places to put things, which was the same in the bathroom, there were no real places to let towels dry. We were given two keys so we left one in the air conditioning, however housekeeping usually removed it so we would put it back in as soon as we got back into the hotel and sit on the rooftop for a bit to allow it to chill off. It is a hotel for tour groups however, during our stay there were separate dining room facilities for the tour groups, we always found empty tables and there is an varied selection of european and asian breakfast options. On the dining room level there is an outdoor seating area which is quite pleasant. We did find reception very crowded on occasions due to the groups and there is very little seating, however reception staff were friendly and attentive. Lifts require a room key which we were not informed of initially, however once we figured out the system, we were quite pleased with it as it adds a safety element, not that you really need it in Singapore. We used the roof top pool on a number of occasions which was clean, functional, and refreshing at the end of the day - there are shower, changing and toilet facilities up there, and the views are nice too. Over all we were pleased with our stay, it was very basic but we knew what we were signing up for and we were really pleased with the location which was perfect as it allowed us to pack in a lot over 4 days. If you turn right out of the hotel at the end of the street there is an excellent hawker place"
"Have you heard of ""Faulty Towers"" comedy show?",Date of stay: October 2016,10,"This hotel is definitely not a comfortable place to be in. The carpet seems to be dusty and needed ripping and changed. It felt like i was stepping back in time when vacuum cleaners are non existent and walking on it would require you to wear some protective gear. The shower is another issue. Aside from full of molds, it looked dirty and needed a refresh, new paint new tiles new everything. Despite being renovated, which was done haphazardly, the room is definitely something you would see in a fifth world country. Most third world country hotels are even more luxurious and cleaner than this! On check in, the staff are friendly but I was deterred by the amount of tourists by the busload arriving (should i dare say Chinese tourists). ABSOLUTELY NO MANNERS pushing their way in the lift even if you are already on the front of the door as if it means life or death. Would I recommend? NO WAY for the price they charge. Will I come back? Probably when I am dead and I would linger in the hotel as a ghost to scare people away and not to come back."
In the middle of everything,Date of stay: June 2017,50,The centrally located hotel is the best place to stay for a memorable trip. A few steps away you can find the metro station Dhobi Ghaut and the Somerset MRT. A good restaurant with a good food and the room ambience was equally delighting. The roof top Pool was a shot in the arm which we enjoyed quite a lot. A nice place for couple like us
Good location,Date of stay: July 2017,30,"Stayed here for a 3 day stop over. It's what you can expect for the price. Singapore is a very expensive city. Good location, near metro and many shopping malls. Room was clean, shower was ok and beds comfy. My only issue was not with the hotel but with very noisy bus tours staying there."
"Good location, friendly staff",Date of stay: August 2017,40,"Upon arriving at the hotel, we were advised that we had been upgraded to a deluxe room. Overall, the hotel was nice and the pool is a good size. The location is good for bars around Orchard Road and Emerald Hill Road."
Average hotel,Date of stay: June 2017,30,"A big hotel, central, near busy road orchard. Check in procedures is so slow, staff not friendly. Room with 2 person but have 1 key card. Wifi not good ( same as the hotel in thailand). The room is small, and nothing special, the bathroom is tiny. Air-con is good. I do not use the breakfast at the hotel, so no idea."
Location is good ...,Date of stay: July 2017,30,The hotel took quite a long time on checking in 10 of us. 5 rooms at different floors. That is OK. But the lobby is very noisy - most guests are tourists?  The room is OK but the design of the shower screen is bad. Only a very small opening to get into the bathtub. Too narrow for a plus size adult and dangerous too.  Only one very good point is its location - very near to the MRT station and some shopping complex.
Disorganised chaos,Date of stay: July 2017,10,I was very disappointed in this hotel. Initially the first night we only had single beds. The beds were rock hard like sleeping on hard phonebooks.  No one knew what they were doing. The only two people were one of the front person and the man who kept fixing our tv.  That kept breaking as well. The rooms were very small and we didn't get breakfast with this deal. I would never stay here again. It was absolute let down. We couldn't wait to get out of here.
Unhappy Stay at Hotel Chancellor @ Orchard,Date of stay: July 2017,20,"Visited on 13 July to 16 July 2017 along with Kesari Tours, India. Rooms are spacious. No soundproof window, heavy traffic noise felt in the room at night. No toiletaries provided in the room and management boasts about the same. Guests asked to collect from reception if they want, they will not send to room! Fantastic service concept! Go to .... if you don't want to take with you! No free wifi, except for the first day as if obliging. Very non cooperative staff at reception, they are least interested in helping you. No useful phone number chart found near room telephone. Lifts are very precious to get in the morning, at the time of breakfast service. Minimum waiting time for lifts is half an hour. Hotel not able to cope with breakfast rush, insufficient tables, I had to have my breakfast standing. Fully Unsatisfactory sevices in hotel, even the feedback form to be given openly, no gummed envelop provided. This devil may care attitude of the management will repel the guests if they visit Singapore repeatedly for business or pleasure."
Excellent location at great prices,Date of stay: July 2017,40,"Pros 1. The hotel is situated next to main metro station -Dhoby Ghat (7-8 minutes walk) 2. Water dispenser in the room, hence no need to pay for bottles 3. Good variety of breakfast 4. Full of foreigners ( less indian people stay as it's a little expensive to little India) 5. Rooms are very clean    Cons 1. Room size are small, no place to open 2 full size luggage 2. It is at one end of Orchard road. 3. You will have to give a security deposit of 50 SGD which is refundable although"
Greetings its a must!,Date of stay: June 2017,20,"They should to value the hospitality for this hotel, no warm welcome from the reception staff, even you guys busy you should follow the standard process, even greetings he forgot! But housekeeping staff they always smiling at you.  Im not shock if the room and toilet is to small but i think if no bath tub is way better!  The good think about this hotel is the location, malls, bars, restaurant, MRT etc. is very near and walkable water dispenser inside of the room is huge help!"
Nice lady at the concierge,Date of stay: June 2017,30,The hotel is small. So everything in there would be according to their size. But the lady at the concierge was nice to us. She attended to us courteously and allowed us to check-in in our rooms early right after we finished signing documents needed for the check-in. June 21 2017 at about 11:30 am. What a nice lady. She gave us also a 110MB free wi-fi. The hotel is right there in the Orchard road area. No problem with shopping and restaurants to eat.
Accessible to Orchard and MRT,Date of stay: June 2017,40,"Walking distance to MRT less than a two minute walk as well as to Orchard road such as reachable to Orchard Plaza, Orchard Central etc. The location was ideally suitable. The breakfast I had tried once in my four days stay, it was so-so. I had a comfortable double bed. The facilities in the room were average. The carpet was clean, no stains whatsoever. I asked for a 4:30am wake up call, the receptionist had forgotten about it and didn't apologise, saying in a surprise tone - is it? I will stay again in my next visit, mainly due to the location itself. Thanks."
Something similar to Budget hotel,Date of stay: June 2017,30,"We booked this hotel expecting it to be a 4 start property, where as our experience was not more than any budget hotel. Brief Positive & Negatives are: Positive side 1) Water Purifier in Room. 2) Swimming pool on terrace is good but no life guard :( 3) Greenery is good. Which is there in entire Singapore.  Negative Side 1) Very small Rooms(Pics uploaded on web site are Altered to show big rooms, but actually very small). On enquiry their manager said its marketing sir.  2) Their confirmed booking with all advance payment means "" as per availability"", we booked this hotel 2 months back, but still on arrival one room was not given as per booking and reply was our confirmation is subject to availability.  3) Deluxe/Superior rooms means just standard room. King size beds means small bed of 6 feet tall and 4.5 feet width(Very uncomfortable for a couple and a small kid). We were given 50 MB Wifi coupons for entire 5 nights stay(Rubbish). No free wifi.  4) Staff was reluctant to help/serve(Very Rude). Or I shd say they don't even know what hospitality means.  5) Not even basic toiletries were given (even after asking one of their staff mentioned it is not provided in this room category, forget about Iron/ shoe shiner etc. Yes we booked Deluxe/Superior rooms :) .  6) Very small bathrooms with no shower glass or even curtain. After single bath complete bathroom was spoiled.  7) In-spite of our individual booking(privately), we were forced to join a degraded breakfast which was for group tours. Menu was pathetic 1) scrambled & Boiled Egg, Sweet Rice with Choley/Beans. mainly Water melon as fruit and Bread with butter & jam.(Its ok if you have paid for a Budget hotel but not for the Deluxe 4 star hotel).  8) And when we showed our disliking for the b/f , last day we were allowed to do b/f in their original cafeteria. Here things were little better but again not upto the mark of 4 star hotel, which it shows but actually is not.  9) They also don't respect Indians customers, even elderly/senior citizens.  10) One day, since we had 1st half free, we reached for B/F around 9:30 am, their staff started closing counters / machines even b4 10 am, whereas, their official timing for b/f is 10 am. After having what ever was left and their showing no courtesy for replenishing things, we wanted to have some tea/coffee, but their manager switched off the machine and even on request did not help us and it was still 9:55 am. This clearly shows they donno what hospitality is all about.  So pls book some other hotel if you are not looking for budget hotel. Thanks"
Perfect location,Date of stay: June 2017,50,"Stayed at this hotel for a day after back from Johor bahru. Location is perfect, short walk to the orchard road and very close shopping centre.  Rooms are decent sized and well appointed. Infront the hotel have foodcourt and very near to sommerset MRT.  Pricing for the amenities is good and i would like to come back here for a stay next time. Definitely worth a stay."
"Good Location, Average Service Except For ONE",Date of stay: June 2017,30,"Stay at this hotel for few days, what can I say about this hotel, accessible in the heart of Singapore. The only bad thing is the food for breakfast was not up to satisfaction. Although it is crowded when we arrived, we were told check in counter was at level 2 but was not directed well. We met Mark upon check in. We were family, and we requested rooms nearby. We find him very thoughful because rooms given nearby easy to communicate with others. Internet 50mb is not enough, which we do not understand why wifi is not free when most hotels give free for entire stay. $12 1 day is a ripoff! Breakfast was not good no vegetarian food and staffs not smiling. Desk staffs very friendly. Although there were some areas we were not happy, we might come back if we stay in Singapore"
"Not bad, but nothing special",Date of stay: May 2017,30,"This place was not bad for the budget. We arrived at 7am due to an early flight and the guy was nice enough to give us our room early. The room was small but suited us fine as we didn't spend much time in the room. The pool area in nice, and the hotel is in a good location."
If only I can give zero stars!!!,Date of stay: June 2017,10,"Terrible service! Toiletries are not replenished every day. Lobby is very smelly. They provided only 100mb of wifi data for the whole stay which is six days!!! This forced us to buy the wifi connection of the hotel worth 32usd for 5days. This was not explained during our check in. I called service operator thrice about the internet, and got hung up twice. They have a very rude phone operator. Breakfast is the worst. Food in hawkers is even better than this hotel. Feels like we're eating in an old school canteen. Terrible terribe terrribbbleee experience! Will never ever recommend!"
Terrible experience,Date of stay: June 2017,20,"Stayed there with a friend for 3 days. Terrible experience 👎. 1 key per room, asked for only 1 plate for the room in case I wanted to put some fruit or whatever on it so I would not have to put it on any of the filthy tables (I wiped them with wet wipes and they were gross) they simply refused the plate to us. Here comes the best part, used my credit card the only time at check-in and when I came home after 3 days there was money missing out of my account for ""i-tunes. We don't have an account for it. Never had this happen at any other hotel all over the world before. Coincidence? I'll let you be the judge......."
Hotel Chancellor at Orchard - Nice Location But Average Service,Date of stay: May 2017,20,"Stayed at this Hotel for 4 Nights 26th, May, 2017 to 29th, May, 2019. Reception staffs were not courteous, when i checked in they demanded a Deposit of S$50. I informed that as i don't have Singapore dollar, i will give 100 US$, so that they can return the same back to me. But that was not acceptable to them, then i had to go to money exchange and get my US $ Changed to Sin $. Room are OK. Wifi is limited to 50 MB for any number of days you stay. House keeping staff are polite and courteous. Breakfast Counter is the worst and the staff are rude, they don't refill if the items gets exhausted. the breakfast timing is till 10 AM, but i suggest to go before 9:30 AM, after that it will be at mercy of the staff and what ever is available you have to have. Roof top pool was locked when i went on 29th, May."
"Below par property, horrible experience",Date of stay: May 2017,20,"A very terrible experience with this hotel with four star status, hotel staff very rude & unprofessional especially service staff at breakfast area, no body to supervise arrangements & listen to guests, food quality is bad & variety offered in breakfast is terrible & repetitive for the whole 3 days, for e.g they served only one fruit i.e. water melon for continued three days..it seems they are doing deliberately like one star hotel . No toiletries given , wifi only 50 MB for the whole 3 days. this hotel should reduce its status to one star. They all are doing nothing not even providing basic amenities on the plea of maintaining green environment which is ridiculous, all other hotels are offering every basic amenities............Basically no frill hotel considering the price they charged, the only saving grace is the location which is a posh area.....the hotel staff & management seems to have forgotten the word hospitality.....for a better green environment they should close this hotel, this place is not recommended at all"
Mr,Date of stay: June 2017,40,Nice hotel within reasonable price in this locality. Need improvements. I have stayed here for 3 days. WiFi is limited to only 50 mb for entire stay. This is very disappointing. Breakfast room is very small compare to hotel .
Not a good experience,Date of stay: May 2017,20,"The location of the hotel is good, moderate pricing, the experience was not as good expected. The food in the buffet was horrible, no body was there to help the guests. One of the worst ever scrambled eggs I ate there. Would definitely not go again, I also found that a lot of racial discrimination towards Indians was prevalent."
Not worth the price,Date of stay: May 2017,20,"This hotel is our 2nd choice since our 1st choice is already fully-booked. Stayed here for 3 nights for business. My first impression to the hotel was actually great, the location is one of the best factors considering that it is near the venue of our event. We had an early check-in around 12nn. The lobby is small, the souvenir shop is not pleasing to the eye, it makes the lobby unattractive. The room we got was small but good enough for 2 persons. First night was good. The next day, the part that changes my great impression to bad impression, we went to the restaurant to take our breakfast. I must say that it is the worst breakfast so far. All are fried or steamed, the chef has no effort in choosing the menu, the ones served are sausages, nuggets, fish fillet etc. These are effortless dishes and I can do it by myself. The eggs are awful too. The restaurant looks like a cafeteria or something. Front desks are not knowledgable around the area. Like seriously? She keeps on telling that we should ask the concierge but for me, they should also know because frontdesk agents are also the source of information. They should have atleast google it for us to let us feel that they exerted extra mile to assist us. I will not stay here again unless the breakfast improves."
Quiet hotel in a busy environment,Date of stay: May 2017,40,"The hotel is surrounded by accessible roads. The roads are one-way direction for vehicles but a pedestrian can access it easily from any direction. Considering the vehicular and human traffic in the environment, one would not believe that such a nice and quiet hotel could be there. There was free Wi-Fi available for guests."
There is SO much that is wrong with this hotel 😡,Date of stay: May 2017,10,"i have visited Singapore many times. It is easy to find yourself in a 5 square metre box with no window, so I did a lot of research. Getting value for money in Singapore is almost impossible. In the end I gave up and acknowledges that if you want a quality hotel you have to pay for it. Well, in this case, we paid for it (dearly) and it was simply awful. Where to begin? THe room was small, but clean. The bed was a double, not a queen, so my feet hung over the end. The minibar was empty. The corridors smelled like stale chip fat. 4 lifts for a 400 room hotel is simply inadequate. It was always horribly crowded. The pool was a pleasant 25 metre rooftop pool, but there wer no towels, no area to change except a small toilet, no covered area for clothes if it rained, and the pool was surrounded by banks of air conditioning which made you feel like you were swimming in a factory. However the WORST thing about this hotel food in the ""restaurant"". I say restaurant advisedly because it was a stark Formica canteen that was crowded, served a bizarre array of food that could only be described as foul and inedible. School canteen is perhaps a compliment. Anyone that has been in prison would no doubt get flashbacks. There were no cooks making omelettes, and the one cooked egg dish was a pre cooked slab of rubber scrambled egg one day and a foul lukewarm runny soup the next. I can eat anything but this was just horrible. So....does paying $230AUD a night in Singapore protect you from a crap hotel with rubbish food? Absolutely not. I would have been better off in a 5 square metre box with no window for half the price. At least that way my expectations would not have been disappointed. I hated this hotel and had several conversations with the Manager who tried to help but short of refunding my money I will always feel ripped off, hence this review to warn others. See you next time? He said as we left. I told him he was an optimist."
Good location,Date of stay: February 2017,40,"We stayed here for 3 nights. It was well placed for travelling around the city. Breakfast catered for all tastes, and was good. Our room was clean and comfortable,there was a safe so valuables could be left in the room. The rooftop swimming pool was great to relax by after a day's sightseeing."
No free Wifi,Date of stay: May 2017,30,"In general, our stay at the hotel was ok. The room was nice and clean, however, the staff gave us a room with 1 queen sized bed despite knowing that we are 3 in one room. Breakfast was ok, it was a buffet and the variety of food is not that bad.  The location is good as it is very near Orchard and just walking distance from Somerset and Orchard Gateway Mall as well as Dhoby Ghaut Station and Somerset Station. What I like is that when you cross the street, there is a hawker place where you can get cheap and delicious food.  The staff are ok, mixed feelings. Some of the staff I found to be snobbish while some are really helpful. However, what I didn't like about my stay is that there is no free Wifi. They only give you 100MB for the whole 3 days and have to pay around S$12 for extra wifi."
STAY AT CHANCELLOR @ ORCHARD,Date of stay: April 2017,30,Stayed at the hotel for two nights.Location of the hotel is excellent as it is only 2/3 minutes walk from orchard road. Staff at the reception are helpful and friendly.But the cleanliness at restaurant for breakfast is not good and needs improvement. The choice for vegetarian breakfast is very limited and needs improvement. There is no live station even for egg preparation.
GREAT,Date of stay: June 2016,40,"Central location, its in the heart of Orchard area hence all high end shops and food outlets are present near by. Good services. The staff is very helpful and amicable. You could have a little problem with the check-in. But over all, a good hotel."
Excellent Hotel for Tourists,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Conveniently located near Dhoby Gaut 650 metres and Somerset 350 metres MRT stations. In the heart of Orchard shopping area. Walkable distance to most shopping malls. Good Night life (pubs). Very friendly and supportive staff. Cost effective. Ideal for tourists.
Staycation,Date of stay: April 2017,40,"After reading the reviews here, i was a bit nervous on how the hotel will be.. but upon reaching at about 3pm, was greeted by a friendly receptionist named Mimi.. checking in went smoothly.. and to my surprised,the premier room with twin beds was very clean and cosy, bathroom was with a small bath tub... a room with no view, but its ok.. one downside though, theres no movie channel.. the pool at the roof top was nice... no onlookers and very private... so, do get the premier room at the top floors, mine was 1041... book through agoda and the rate was quite reasonable for a hotel in orchard road..."
Annual hoilday,Date of stay: April 2017,30,Its an ok hotel without frills. Breakfast medium. Though location is good at Orchard road and reasonably priced. Take the rooms above 5th floor and facing the road...excellent view from the room. Concierge was helpful. 100 MB internet during the whole stay...disappointing
Bad and old hotel,Date of stay: April 2017,20,"This hotel is situated on a priviledge place but is completely useless! The internet Connection is horrible. Every time you og in and out of the room you have to Connect again. No Connection if you og from Your room to another floor or another room in a different floor and absolutely no Connection on the pool! This is old days and defenitely NOT an hotel to use for business. The hotel is badly and very poor equiped and the rooms are small, ugly and very old....carpeting from wall to wall which is antihygenic and very bad for asmatich People or People With alleregies! The reseption is very little attractive and no bar service is available. This hotel is basically for Asian tour operators. No Europeans here therefore the standard very different. Breakfast is very poor and the scramble eggs are like Soup! Absolutely horible! I do not recoomend this place at all even the location is good. Spend a copule of dollars more and get a better hotel!"
"Great location, decent enough hotel",Date of stay: April 2017,30,"Stayed for 2 nights as part of a tour but luckily wasn't in the hotel for very long. Very tight rooms, tour buffet breakfast had very limited options, wifi was very weak almost to the point of un-usable, and our TV was broken twice. Staff was friendly though, such as maintenance coming right away to fix our TV although it was broken twice. Shower was dirty but I just washed it away. Only redeeming factor is that it's in a good location off Orchard Road and easy to go shopping and eating outside. Would not stay here again though."
Disappointing,Date of stay: April 2017,30,"Mixed feelings about this hotel I booked through Singapore Airlines. Mark at check-in and out was wonderful and he is a credit to the hotel. I very much appreciated the late checkout. The room however was not cleaned well and had a terrible smell. The hotel is in a great location just one street back from Orchard Road. I had booked a deluxe room with breakfast with my Singapore Airlines flight. The room was definitely not Deluxe. The breakfast I had at around 9am. The vegetable buns and hash browns were cold; the scrambled eggs were runny and cold; there was only some poor looking watermelon for fruit. Overall, apart from Mark, the hotel was disappointing."
The staff and managers are cheats.,Date of stay: April 2017,10,"Horrible experience! The staff are cheats of the highest order. They take a deposit of 150 dollars at the start and never refund the whole amount, as they slap you with random bills of calls and internet charges that you never made or used. When they realise their mistake, they do not apologise and say things like ""Its just 60$."" After this incident I spoke to other guests and all of them complained of the same thing. The hotel slaps you with bills of random charges and HOPES you don't see them. I still have to get 60$ back from them after proving that I have not made calls from the room."
Worst hotel in orchard,Date of stay: April 2017,20,"Location : Good  Bed: Standard  Service: Worst!!!!!!!!! How come house keeping force me to clean the room while we are still sleeping!!! Knocking all the time!!!  Front desk The stupid front desk, i dont know why to check in room take so long time, so we decided left for a window shopping then lunch+dinner, then we back, still need present the passport again like first time, i dont know what we are waiting for during window shopping, lunch and dinner  Breakfast? I dont know why the breakfast were divided into 2 part ; group and individual/non group  BETTER NON GROUP BREAKFAST WHY? Cause the variety of food of group breakfast just like compliments not complete as individuals  Maybe someone will said I get group breakfast cause booking a group, thats right, but i saw a hockey team player from sydney consist about 20 people get breakfast in non group breakfast!!! Really unfair!  So folks rethink if you want to stay in here,  Next to this hotel are club, many girls and bouncers in the midnight"
"Good Location, average facilities",Date of stay: March 2017,30,"We spent 3 days in this hotel which is situated in the heart of the shopping district of Singapore, many nice eating places within easy walking distance.  The hotel room was clean but basic. Entry foyer somewhat ""off putting"". Eating facilities clean but basic."
A nice weekend,Date of stay: April 2017,40,Good and prime location. Good front end service. Good drinking water (have a drinking equipment in every room). The breakfast quality soso. But we will come back for the next vacation on singapore. Bravo
Great location,Date of stay: March 2017,50,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here with our family, the location is very close to everything we needed. Susan hoo at the tours desk was very helpful to us, she booked all our tours with a mini bus to and from. Susan also gave us lots of helpful tips and tricks make the most of our stay."
Fantastic,Date of stay: April 2017,50,"The Chancellor Hotel was a fantastic place to stay whilst visiting Singapore in late March, great facilities and also highly recommend Susan Hoo the tour organiser at the Hotel she did a fantastic job with all our tours and pick ups were always on time. Would highly recommend this hotel and Susan for all your activities in Singapore"
Susan was awesome,Date of stay: April 2017,50,"Hotel was nice, comfortable and very clean. Susan hoo booked our tours and attractions for us and she was an excellent help with tips and tricks to help us enjoy our holiday to the fullest! Highly recommend booking through her!"
Better than other budget hotels...,Date of stay: April 2017,40,"At the very least, the hotel is better than other budget hotels.  We stayed twice here and stayed in their Premier Room. Rooms are clean and decent, with a good hot and cold water dispenser so we do not need to boil our own water.  Premier rooms come with a small bathtub, free WiFi and a smart TV that you can watch YouTube.  Amenities in the room are pretty decent and room is rather spacious. The hotel staff are very friendly, especially Ms Jenny who is the Duty Manager there.  The only downside is that their breakfast is not very good.  Do not take the rooms that are at the far end from the lift because at night the music from the pub below is very loud and can disturb sleep."
Great location,Date of stay: February 2017,40,"A friend and I stayed two nights here. We chose the hotel because of the location and this turned out to be just as we expected, perfectly situated for what we wanted with limited time. The room was comfortable, the reception staff were helpful. Only downside was the complexity of understanding how to use the hot and cold water dispenser. We finally managed to get boiling water out of it for a cup of tea the morning we left. Give me a good old fashioned kettle any day."
Best budget hotel,Date of stay: May 2016,40,"Visited about a years back with my wife on our honeymoon trip. Stayed for 4 nights, very comfortable rooms for couple, interiors are fine. Take their breakfast buffet, its a must have before you go out for sight seeing. A sumptuous buffet, but you have to come on time. Overall rating is 3.5-4 star. Situation nearby with a walking distance of not more than 10 minutes is the mustafa mall and the Ananda Bhawan a paradise for vegans. Backyard of the hotel has some indian restaurants where you can have food that suits the pocket."
A hotel with a great location,Date of stay: March 2017,30,"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. The rooms are very small but neat and clean. The hotel is in a very strategic location with access to metro and Orchard road and many shopping malls. The Internet in the rooms is a 20Mps access. In the room, you can find a smart TV that by using that you can experience online TV and gaming, etc. Also, there is a machine for giving you hot water and cold water. I love these innovations in the hotels that give the customer a good experience. There is a small shop in the lobby with a friendly and nice seller in that you can buy drinks and souvenirs at a good price. The breakfast in disappointing and it dose not offer you too much. Air conditioning system works well without any noise that offer you a good experience."
Worst hotel I've ever stayed,Date of stay: March 2017,10,In March my husband and my self had booked to stay at this hotel for a couple of nites before going on a cruise and a nitre went coming off the cruise (payed up front ) Flour 8 on both stays  1st stay room 813 Room very smal with two single bed pushed together to make a double Pillow smelt of vomit which was changed Very smal room and bathroom (no bath walk in shower) Thin dirty carpet very very basic Large flour to wall windows (not suitable for anyone afraid of heights) Veiws of the smal garden and the rest of the rooms Tv worked occasionally no English channels Internet you are given a small amount then you are charged which is not explained to you until you check out and are given the bill Check in staff not helpful at all trip booking staff helpfull and friendly Brakefast or should I say snacks Apple was only fruit one flavour of yougar cold scrambled egg no bacon no sausage or boiled eggs Nor was there any rolls or cheese no cold meats bottom line not a lot to go on If you were oozed in as part of a group you went to another dinning room were all was available There are a large number of groups/ children stay here Never saw the bar open which is also were brakefast is served Not a hotel for me It is around 15 Singapore dollars to go to the marina 15 to sentiosa island 10 to go to the flyer/ port taxi outside hote but no taxi driver new the hotel on return 2nt nite we were kept wake till 5am due to the nite club music and the taxis/people coming and going No hot water for coffee Room smelt of urine although bed was clean I think it was the carpets Would not recommend this hote
holiday,Date of stay: February 2017,50,"the room was a bit small but we were high up on the 9th floor the view was great we where at the back of the hotel so looked out at the big wheel and the hotel with the ship built on top , the breakfast was poor and busy at the week ends . we did alot of walking and tried the open top bus which is great by the way you see loads by doing this. you need to get to the docks to see most of the stuff this place has to offer and go to raffles for your singapore sling."
Good Location,Date of stay: March 2017,30,The Location is good for Shopping..it is Close to the orchard road.Rooms are small but clean.Breakfast was dissapointed.Walking Distance to MRT Station & Any Kind of Cusine Resturant.Average 3star hotel
Holiday,Date of stay: March 2017,30,"Strategic location for Orchad circuler trip, nice location for shopping, easy to get any kind of meal. The room was clean and tidy with quite compact composition setting, also intersting dispenser for water (cold n hot)."
"Good price, great location",Date of stay: March 2017,30,"Stayed here for 4 days. Friendly front desk, small room, and even smaller bathroom. Shower is inside elevated tub which has a glass partition, aside grom the curtain,making it difficult to get in and out, with the danger of you slipping. No rubber mat inside tub. Their hot and cold shower is never consistent because it suddenly turns very hot or very cold. No bidet which is sad news for my family. The plus is their location, being in Orchard Road where all the good shopping malls are with in walking distance.. but be sure to check out IMM first before you buy in Orchard."
3 night stopover,Date of stay: February 2017,50,"Lovely hotel in ideal location. Rooms immaculate but not very big ,however everything you need at hand,a big window from floor to ceiling giving you a great view of some of the city (we had room 109).breakfast was not the worst or best we've had but plenty if choice.the roof top pool was lovely to relax in after a days sightseeing..plenty of taxis outside on corner aswell as a ""hawkers"" who did great local food n beer....we ate there all the time before exploring."
Stop over in Singapore,Date of stay: March 2017,30,"We stayed here for 3 nights on our return home from Australia. We arrived late evening and check in wax quick and easy. We had a room on the 9 floor which was quite high - not good if you do not like heights! It was fine even if a little on the small side. Bathroom was also small but clean and more than adequate for our needs. Wi fi was totally reliable. Breakfast catered for a range of tastes and cultures although eggs looked a little watery and not very inviting. Plenty of juices and tea and coffee. the location of the hotel is good being close to the main shopping malls, underground and places to eat. Taxis are easy come by right outside and are very cheap. The swimming on the roof is great with toilets and showers and views over the city. Staff helpful although maid will remove key card from electricity connection if you leave it in. Ideal for a short stay."
Not the best but great location,Date of stay: March 2017,30,Great location. Friendly staff. Room small. Housekeeping......was there any ???? Shower over a deep bath extremely dangerous for the less agile. Close to Somerset MRT and Orchard Rd. Breakfast.....absolutely disgusting. Better value elsewhere
"Not a bad hotel, good location..",Date of stay: February 2017,40,"The hotel is a bit hidden away, a few taxi drivers had rouble finding it, but it's a decent hotel.  The rooms are clean but small, small bathrooms that have an odd shaded glass wall between the shower and the bedroom..  The rooftop pool is good, it's open 7am-8pm and is very long, it's a good addition..  The hotel is next to a small food market and shops and massage clinics, although there were a fair few professional ladies that hung about the foyer after about 8pm which was a bit off putting..  I would stay there again.."
Not that good,Date of stay: March 2017,30,"The entrance is a car/coach park. The bed was comfortable and sheets clean. Bathroom needed detail cleanings. Rooms small. For the price I would not stay here again. The reception services need new training, it seams they have to pick up the phone on the second ring, as well as servicing you. The hotel is right by a main road and you can hear the road all night."
"Overpriced hotel room, no good service",Date of stay: February 2017,30,"Location is in CBD, just walk. Check in time was so slow even not many people. Some of receptionists' accent were so difficult to understand. Have been booked 3 rooms, we wanted rooms close together. They said 2 rooms were ready and 1 not. That was good coz we checked in 1 hour early, they said we could come back to get it if we go out and all rooms would be nearby. After 2:00pm came to get room, they gave us a room on another floor. It's Inconvenient. Overall everything was ok. Staffs were not friendly and helpful."
Strategically located,Date of stay: February 2017,40,"This hotel located in just a walking distance to anywhere. MRT, Malls, bus stop and at the biggest shopping district in Singapore.  Room is clean and spacious. Breakfast standards.  Didn't have any issues when check in."
Great Location on Orchard Road,Date of stay: March 2017,30,"Room very small, especially when sharing with a 9 and 4 year old. Bathroom was a tad dangerous for anyone getting on in years step into bath had grab rails but no anti slip mat in the bath.Adequate for a short stay , rooftop pool was great for a dip after sightseeing, usually had it to ourselves.Lots of noisy tour groups , didn't try the restaurant as heaps of places to eat close by, MRT station is a short walk away."
Pathetic,Date of stay: February 2017,20,Stayed at this hotel as a part of large group in February.Rooms are cleaned daily but tea/coffee are not replenished properly and the quantity is very small.Rooms are little bit smaller and cramped . Bed are not suitable for tall people.Breakfast is separate for tour groups and service there was a nightmare.Even for hot milk they are charging extra Singapore dollar during breakfast.If you are a vegetarian then avoid breakfast at hotel. Even cups were missing at tea coffee station during breakfast.The staff have to be reminded for such matters .will not come back again.
Spacious room in the corner of orchard road,Date of stay: February 2017,40,"We can found this hotel in the corner of orchard road behind malls building. Chancellor @Orchard has great location, taxi stop is straight in front of hotel door, bus stop and MRT (Somerset station) station can reach by under 5 min walking. There are many food stalls and convince store around hotel. When stayed here i got spacious and modern room. Everything almost OK except i can hear loud music from somewhere that make me can not sleep well, may be they should improve their room with noise reduction. Their have rooftop pool which have great view. This pool is narrow but still comfort enough for swim there."
hotel at orchard road,Date of stay: February 2017,20,"this hotel is at orchard road. no pick up from airport. check in very slow. they have dispenser on room. nice location closed to orchard. but orchard road is very expensive, if you want cheap go to bugis junction... no wifi"
Short Visit,Date of stay: February 2017,30,We visited the hotel Chancellor Orchard for very less time i.e. 3 hours. The visit was very comfortable and the staff was co-operative. The ambience of the hotel was also good. The indian food offered was average in taste.
Good location but not good service,Date of stay: February 2017,20,"We stayed there for 5 night with my friends for business trip we spend not much in room only sleep,hotel location good nearly MRT,shopping town, and Food center in hotel breakfast we been only 1 time and finish many people there food all finished that time at 9 am glass finish staff not enough food no one fill we walk around Children make dirty we can't sit and eat we leave , points is staff who take care breakfast not enough, I check out early but my friend still in room ,point of service at reception 1 guest check in with many problems because he not sure pay or not and need extra night he came before me but I asking lady at reception listen me just 1minute ,i just wanted to return key and leave,l will lost my flight soon I wait almost 20 minutes / i say sorry and tell her seem both of them don't understand what i try to do, they fill I disturb their conversation , I really understand for first come first serve but what priority and urgent ,hotel very big need separate cashiers for check out and reception for check in , this hotel for group very good but all process should be support and make all smooth  Room prices not cheap  Staff unfriendly , lady short hair never smiles If she try to listen guest every easy and smooth  I worked for 8 years in hospitality management  Service mind very important  Thank you"
Rudest staff ever,Date of stay: February 2017,10,"Maybe I am used to the polite and best hospitality services of hotels in Bali. My experience staying in this hotel was very unpleasant. I called the front desk if they have an adaptor for my phone, and suggested to use the adaptor behind the TV. So, I unplugged the one behind the TV and the TV was off. I contacted the front desk if she could send someone to help me. Politely she answered and sent a technician. Came this small technician guy with a grumpy face and scolded me for unplugged the adaptor behind the TV. I just couldn't believe if someone who work in hospitality would being rude to their guest. Questioning myself if this kind of attitude is normal in this country?"
Had a 6 day stay and were pleasantly surprised,Date of stay: February 2017,40,We arrived early in the morning and were given a early check in room. We wondered why the room was available and that night found out - we were directly above a (terrible) karaoke bar. After the second night we asked to be moved and were moved immediately to the other wing of the hotel overlooking the gardens. Really quiet and stunning. The staff were friendly and we had a great stay. The room was clean and immaculate. Had a little run in on our last day - we had a 6pm late check out and so our room was not cleaned that morning - thought it a little cheeky!  The pool on the rooftop is amazing and helped cool off after loads of sightseeing.
Stay Away At All Costs,Date of stay: February 2017,10,"The hotel is a very busy bus-loaded tourist group hotel with people coming and going all the time. The hotel purports to be in its “soft opening stage” after being renovated but I think this message may have been up for a long time now. Positives; fast efficient check in and check out, beautiful rooftop pool, great centralised location to Orchard Rd, the MRT and buses. NEGATIVES: Very old hotel that has been “renovated” in the cheapest possible way. Rooms are extremely small with very cheap worn carpet, a small bed that was supposed to be a queen size where my feet hung out over the end and I’m only 175cm tall, if you rolled over you rolled out of the bed, broken fixtures, rising damp, crumbling ceilings and the smallest most disgusting mould ridden bathroom I have ever used in a hotel that I had to buy bleach to clean it before using. I only stayed one night and asked to be moved to another room but was told they were fully booked. Its definitely not a place I would recommend or stay again. My pictures speak a thousand words."
TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE HOTEL!!!,Date of stay: January 2017,10,"THE WORST HOTEL!!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! BLOOD STAINS IN HOTEL!!! We were given a hotel room the size of a shoe box. The bathroom ceiling was mouldy, there were stains on the bed sheets that did not get replaced AND we found blood stains on the toilet bowl...URGGG!!! The outside of the hotel smells of sewage, and across the road is Sex shop, dodgy massage store, and a condom shop. AND on top of that the staff were disrespectful, and rude!!!!!! (and they can afford to be as they get a lot of group bookings so they don't care).Plus, the breakfast didn't seem fresh to us... GUYS DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND DON'T GO THERE!!!!"
Touristic category but Singapore hotel prices are always too expensive,Date of stay: February 2017,30,Hotel for big group of tourist. It has a good relation between price and quality but anyhow it costed 120 euro per night. Singapore has an unjustified high level of prices for hotels... whoever passes in Singapore is a lemon to be squeezed. Unfortunately is quite impossible to find a price lower than this ...
Pretty good,Date of stay: January 2017,40,"Stayed at this property for a day while on a business trip. Location is excellent, short walk to the orchard road and in close proximity to decent shopping malls. Rooms are decent sized and well appointed. Room service is quick and food is nice. Did not try their buffet but liked the room service menu options. The entire hotel is non-smoking so you have to go all the way out to have a smoke. Pricing for the amenities is good and i would like to come back here for a stay next time. Definitely worth a stay."
Good location,Date of stay: January 2017,30,"Located on nice & clean city. It is easy to go to the shopping center and visit some famous places. I went there with group from agent, breakfast they prepared for group was so boring and simple. It was the same food for all 4 days in there. The rest were ok."
Holiday with my nephew and brother,Date of stay: January 2017,40,"Just recently had a holiday in Singapore and got to stay at Hotel Chancellor @ Orchard Rd. Excellent place, excellent people, cozy room, nice food. Hotel has a swimming pool on the 10th floor what better than end the hard day swimming on the rooftop and enjoying the beautiful night scenery. Close to all the amenities as the night life is very vibrant...for those who just want to take a stroll down the busy market place or enjoy the food outdoor...best location...Had a great time alltogether. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to go there :)"
Nice location,Date of stay: January 2017,30,"Room & location are good. Easy to access. Near to 7-11, food stall n orchard shopping mall. Internet wifi is limited only 100mb for ur stay, too bad:(( but i like to recommend this hotel for ur stay @orchard singapore."
Great position and value,Date of stay: January 2017,40,Comfortable and affordable. Although small in size I found it clean and well worth the money for Singapore. Very close to Orchard road and easy to get around shopping and restaurant. Staff were friendly and front desk was fast and efficient. Would definitely stay again.
Excellent location,Date of stay: November 2016,40,"Excellent location, the hotel was located 2 minutes walk from orchard rd(excellent shopping location)and near the MRT. The room was clean and tidy, the beds comfortable. Staff were helpful and friendly. If we go back to Singapore we will definitely be staying here."
Don’t expect too much,Date of stay: December 2016,30,I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights for business purpose.  Hotel location is excellent. It is located next to Orchard Road. 3 minute walking distance to Orchard Central and 5 minutes walking distance to Somerset MRT station.  Hotel room is small but fine for 1 person. Bathroom is small.  My room is next to a highway. The view is good but it is quite noisy in the day time.  The cleaning is not good. I found a card left by previous customer in the curtain.  Hotel is a little bit new but the maintenance is bad. I found the shower is damaged.  NO FREE WIFI. It is quite incredible.
Very Surprised.,Date of stay: January 2017,40,After reading previous reviews about this Hotel we were extremely apprehensive to check in. We were pleasantly surprised although we got to the Hotel 2.5hrs early there was no fuss to give us a room and the girl at reception was friendly and helpful. Room was clean and was serviced everyday without a fuss although we slept in till late on a few occasions. All we can say is that we had a great stay there and will return.
Good for price and excellent service!!,Date of stay: January 2017,50,"To be honest, I was trying to find an ""okay"" hotel with good value because i'm traveling with limited budget. I chose Chancellor because the location is perfect at orchard road and the price is the lowest on its quality level. When I arrived, the room space is not so small as I've expected and it is exactly the same like what you see in their profile. Its clean and tidy. The interior is kind of new. On top of everything, i lost a valuable thing in the room and the service by the hotel manager was excellent! His name is Jack and I will never forget. He helped me a lot and called me to pick up the item the day after. I would recommend u guys to try and stay here of you are traveling with budget. The value for its quality is superrr! Totally worth every penny.."
a comfortable stay,Date of stay: December 2016,30,"We had gone to attend a wedding in Singapore and booked to stay in this hotel. When we landed at the hotel, no bell boy was available to take care of our luggage. We managed. We were booked into a room on the 3rd floor, that is not accessible by just any one. Now that is good but the people that checked us in did not tell us that we have to swipe our key in the lift to be able to access the third floor. Well we pressed the button for the 3rd floor. It did not light up but almost immediately the lift started going up but did not stop at the 3rd floor. Went up to 5th and some people entered and pressed for ground. We again pressed for 3rd but the lift did not stop there. This went on till another person swiped his card and the 3 rd floor button lit up. That person told us what needs to be done. The room was definitely comfortable though rather small but then you get what you pay for. In the morning we usually have more than one cup of tea each, but the house-keeping told us that only one each tea bag is provided in the room and that we need to go down and buy additional. The TV channels were very limited, perhaps 9 or 10; and none suiting an Indian background or british for that matter. The wifi internet speed was good but limited by time per day. Well! OK. They did provide fresh towels every day. We stayed only three nights and did not ask for a change of sheets, which is OK. The room is of course air conditioned but the temperature is fixed and it can not be varied to suit your preference. Yes, they do have a shop near the reception where one can buy tea bags, etc. The receptionist did advice that getting a taxi arranged by the hotel would be expensive and instead we just call for one and we will get one at no additional charge."
Worst stay,Date of stay: January 2017,10,"Front desk receptionist and on duty manager lack of communication. They treat guest very poorly, no manner and arrogant. Hotel should be training their staff accordingly. Never change the bedsheets. Stayed for 11 days and I have to leave a note to ask for change bedsheets. Worst restaurant, not a good food at all. Choose this hotel for a good location. Only location makes this hotel attractive. No 24 hrs room service. Next time won't be staying here as for bad hotel staffs."
Worst experience ever,Date of stay: January 2017,10,"I have never been so disappointed and frustrated by a hotel like this one! This is a pretty new hotel and located in the area of Orchard Road. Therefore I expected a hotel that is well organized, clean, and well-equipped. But it's totally a disaster! In the evening we arrived, we waited more than 15 minutes for check-in when there was 1 other guest checking in. The so called manager had no awareness of serving guests prior to her busy computer stuff until her supervisor told her to do so! But in the middle of the check-in, she passed us to another receptionist and the guy refused us when we reached out to him! This was so ridiculous. Finally when we got to our rooms, we check the rooms and find out stains, spots, and smell in the bathrooms. There's no directory, no description of phone calls. The safety lock are half finished. The carpets are dirty and all toilettes were in cheaper quality than those motels in China.  I wrote to the hotel reservation to reserve for a baby cot in July and they didn't answer until I emailed again in December! Then on the day of arrival, they didn't gave us the baby cot until I reminded them. But...their answer was they weren't able to provide it until 6 pm because there was another guest using it. You can imagine that they didn't get the baby cot ready at 6 pm until we asked again!  The worst thing of all is there were cockroaches in the room where the baby and her parents stay!!!! Can you believe it?!!!  When we check-out after staying for 4 nights, they charged us for local phone calls. And the phone calls were made to the restaurant of the hotel which was unanswered!!!  I can say this is the worst hotel experience I've ever had in my 30 years of traveling! The only good comment for it is the location, which is close to Orchard Road."
One day stay for business,Date of stay: January 2017,40,"Big modern rooms, very clean and up to date, hotel only 12 months old. Breakfast was great, hotel staff are very approachable and knowledgeable of the things to do in and around the city. With tours leaving the hotel regularly."
worst rustic hotel service!!!!!!,Date of stay: December 2016,20,we stayed in the hotel from 23rd december 2016 to 27th december 2016.  It was a terrible experience for me and my family we stayed for about 5 days in that hotel and it was my worst experience of the hotel .  room service was terrible. no international television which is no international television channels. the free internet is only for the sake of saying even if u take the first class room u get only 100 mega byte of data till your checkout date. only 2 sugar and 2 tea bag for a day for 3 persons. no daily newspaper. no proper wash room kits. no dental kit. no light in swimming pool shower and wash room. late room check in service. no lobby sitting arrangement.  being a reviewer do not take this hotel
Underrated service,Date of stay: January 2017,10,"Maybe they didn't manage the staff well or they haven't train the employee how to handle guests in a good way. The receptionist seems like not willingly to service the guests, or even ask what the guests need more. Breakfast horrible... the waiter, the Chef they do not know how to speak to the guests with manner. yes, the hotel maybe one of the cheapest at the area and of course they will serve you with ""the cheap"" way. Never return to this hotel again."
Very Disappointed!!,Date of stay: December 2016,10,"We stayed at this hotel in December 2015 and were very happy with everything. This year December 2016 we had booked into the same hotel with another 2 couples friends. When we arrived to do a check in, the receptionist totally had no customer service at all. She was rude and wasn't sure of her job. The manager on duty probably knew what was going on but choose to ignored it. The only friendly people in this hotel are the 2 bell boys we had met. They were friendly and greeted every guests whenever we see them. Got into the rooms, it was dirty and toilet was smelly. Check with the other 2 couples, they said the same thing. We were so embarrassed as we had highly recommended this hotel to them. Location is good but I won't stay in this hotel at all. This hotel is only one and half year old but the place looks 10 years old. We were very disappointed. Sad that they don't maintain the hotel well."
Location,Date of stay: December 2016,50,"This hotel is near orchard road,which is one of the posh locality with world class shopping malls and showrooms.little india is not too far from here easily accessible by mrt and cabs.hotel is decent in amenities with rooftop swimming pool though rooms are not spacious ,but has all the amenities. One thing i liked most was the water dispenser serving hot and cold water and the hotel's effort to stay green"
Excellent Hotel. Handy location,Date of stay: December 2016,50,"We stayed at this hotel for a week, right on orchard road. We visited during Christmas and the street was well decorated. The hotel is close to shopping malls and food joints. Opposite to the hotel is a hawker place where you get good food. Hotel is 15 to 20min walk to the nearest MRT. We had to take taxi couple of times after a tiring day. When in Singapore you need to do a lot of walking so be prepared for it. Average cost for a cab would range from $10 to $25. Rooms are small and clean. Good enough for couple. The premises is well maintained. Roof top pool is clean and accessible only with one lift. Mark at the reception helped us with a smooth and early check in. We arrived at 11:00am and were allowed to check in. The reception staff are friendly except one when asked about suggestions he was rude and not interested to answer. Overall had a pleasant stay."
Average accomodation in a handy location,Date of stay: December 2016,30,"We stayed here as a family and were allocated two rooms that were on the same floor but a few doors apart. Rooms were small but functional and looked to have been refurbished recently. The hotel seems to be a haven for tour groups, we booked through Singapore airlines stopovers as independent travellers. The lobby was chaotic at times and the attention of the staff was a little lacking, but it was a pretty functional place to sleep with air conditioning that worked, and that's mandatory in Singapore."
Stay feedback,Date of stay: January 2017,10,Surprisingly horrible experience!!  1) cold/hot water in shower and tap were not sync ; getting cold for few seconds and then hot. 2) not worth the price ; you can find much better hotels at lesser than there quotation! 3) extremely poor service ! Cold gestures from people at reception. 4) we asked for extra cup/glasses in the night and were told that they had to check with manager whether they can provide or not. We kept waiting and then called to follow up and were told that they cant provide and we should manage with whats provided (2 in total). 5) no 24 hours in room dining available. 6) disappointing swimming pool - looks like a kid pool ! No one available to attend at pool and no towels were made available. 7) room window curtains were broken.  We arrived in singapore on 28 dec and checked in at park hotel (clarke quay) which was a superb hotel and tariffs were much lower than chancellor ! We shifted to chancellor for 31dec-2jan as wanted to stay on orchard road and we truly regretted this decision as clarke quay was much happening !  A big NO for tourist planning to book this hotel - awful service and food !
Central and accessible,Date of stay: December 2016,50,"Centrally located and easily accessible, with the humming shopping area ""Orchard Road"" a short walk away, this is the hotel to opt for.  You have the MRT stations - Orchard Road, Somerset, Dhoby Ghat within 10 mins walking distance and also with the excellent network of buses, you can move around the city with ease.  The hotel rooms are nice and decently equipped for your stay. The coffee shop offers a nice selection of breakfast setting the base for your day ahead.  With all elite brands and shopping malls (OG, Metro etc), you have an array of street side dining joints offering world-wide delicacies/cuisines, is what makes this hotel an option to go for.  The lobby has a small shop which offers some basic medicines in case required, in addition to the knickknacks.  Overall a nice and comfortable stay.  A special note of thanks for Blaire Lee/Duty Manager, who provided a lot of assistance :)"
Value for money,Date of stay: December 2016,40,"Close enough to the prime location of Orchard Rd. Hotel is very easy to find and great access via MRT. It's just behind Concorde hotel and about 3 minutes stroll to Orchard Gateway & 313 Somerset. Another direction will bring you to Plaza Singapura and MRT Station.  Building seems like an old establishment but was heavily refurbished. Everything is brand new, only the lobby that seems a little worn out. Room has a very good size for this price and this location. Double insulated glass also help a lot to keep the room nice and quiet.  Overall a good and comfortable stay."
Nice hotel near Orchard,Date of stay: December 2016,40,"This hotel is near food court and hotel grand central. I think this hotel is suitable for group tour because of the location. I like the water dispenser in every room and the swimming pool. For the room, I think it's just fit for 3 person (2 adult+1 child). I love the rain shower in the bathroom.  The price was okay for hotel near Orchard area, the service was poor (below poor maybe). There's no greetings and no smile from each staff. Don't expect much from the breakfast, my husband hated it because to simple and boring."
So friendly hotel,Date of stay: November 2016,40,"I am Iranian tour guide. We stayed in this nice hotel from 26 November 2016 until 29 Nov. 2016 . We were about 48 people . 45 of them were female , just 3 of my passengers were men . A lot of them were retired teachers. When we arrived hotel . All the staffs welcomed us with smiling faces and we got good energetic and we forgot our tiring . All of us checked in as soon as possible . The assistant welcomed us and was so kind . He gave a lot of information about Singapore to me. He gave us the map of Singapore. In the evening we wanted to go to the sea and how to go and there he helped us and hired 2 mini buses for us.We enjoyed a lot .  The rooms were clean . But as we expect clean places but the restaurant was not so clean . I hardly find the clean table to sit. The cups weren't washed cleaned. The uniform of staffs in restaurant was so boring and some of them didn't wear uniform . I needed something to print . The receptionist helped me to print it. The lady who works at Tour desk is so kind and helpful woman . I thank her a lot.  She promised me to send tour to my country Iran . The view of my room was so beautiful .  When we wanted to leave hotel to our country the assistant escorted us to the bus. As my city ""Tabriz"" will be the capital of Islamic country in 2018 I invited the duty management and tour desk and others to come to Iran and Tabriz in 2018.  Whenever I decide to go to Singapore I'll choose this hotel, too. For some reasons: 1. All the lobby's clerk have smile face and they are kind. 2. It's located in the best area and is close every where.  Best wishes"
Service was poor.,Date of stay: November 2016,30,This hotel is central and near Orchard Road so great for shopping. Had a late checkout from here and when I returned to my room at 11.30am (checkout was midday) I found that my card to 'power' the room wouldn't work. Consequently I had to finish packing in the dark as there was very little natural light. The staff weren't very friendly or helpful towards westerners.
Mediocre but perhaps the cheapest choice in the area,Date of stay: November 2016,20,"I have several issues with this hotel.  The major one is about booking.  I booked this hotel on a third party website three weeks before my trip, but payment was to the hotel direct upon check-in. I booked the wrong type of room accidentally as the design of the booking website is a bit misleading. But I found out this mistake immediately , and called the hotline of the third party hotel booking website to request cancellation within 3 minutes after I booked. The next day, the booking website called back and informed me that the hotel refused to cancel the reservation and would deduct the full amount from my credit card if I cancelled. However, as a gesture of goodwill, the booking website would refund the whole amount to me. What a relief!  I am so surprise that this hotel is so rigid about the booking, and the move of charging my credit card immediately after learning my cancellation (instead of wait till the day when I no show) is bad. While I got refund from the hotel booking website, unless the website is telling lie, I truly appreciate that and it reflects badly on this hotel.  When I checked in, the hotel assigned a room facing the wall of another building to me. I objected because the booking clearly stated the room was city view. After I insisted, the hotel said that it was not guaranteed and subject to availability! But a few seconds after it was said, the hotel gave me another room with a view of the city.  I think the above reflects how badly the hotel manages the reservation.  Regarding the room, the bathroom inside is a bit small. The overall size of the room is not bad. Some rooms use bathtub and some have walk-in shower. The boiler in the room for hot drinking water, while looks weird, is a really good thing. My family had two rooms, and one room had dirts on the wall which looks bad.  Some promotion materials mentioned that the hotel was opened in 2015. From what I observed, this hotel might be a refurbished/ renovated one rather than a brand new hotel. When I stayed here in November 2016, there was re-painting work in some hallways.  The location of the hotel is really convenient. It is not far from Somerset MRT and bus stops on Orchard Road are just a few steps away.  It is a hotel that enjoys a good location and stay here if you want to be close to Orchard Road and couldn't find anything cheaper. Frankly, the room is okay for its price. But if it is not selling cheap, then you should perhaps consider other areas to stay."
It is still all about people,Date of stay: December 2016,40,"We have been to better hotels but Chanchellor is a standout because of one particular employee. We were on our second day of our stay when much to our chagrin we were told that we missed our tour group by a few minutes. Apparently the tour guide was on a tight schedule and decided to leave without us. Ms. Constantine who was then among those manning the front desk went out of her way to contact the tour agency and the guide so that we could catch up with the tour. She pleaded, begged, cajoled, appealed to the tour operator to accomodate us. She also pleasantly engaged us in small talk in between the several calls that she had to make. When she finally succeded to convince the operator to reconsider our case, she called for a taxi, waited with us at the main entrance and gave the driver instructions where to take us. She also gave us her personal number just in case we encounter problems along the way. She was simply amazing! A hotel is not all about amenities nor facilities. It is all about its people."
Handy location,Date of stay: October 2016,40,"This hotel offers good accommodation at a realistic price just off Orchard Road adjacent to cheap eats. Staff are friendly, easy walking distance to train station and the wonderful shopping centres along Orchard Road."
Good value of money,Date of stay: November 2016,40,Its was Great Staying in chancellor Value for Money good location good Hotel for Person who only want come and sleep . Hotel staff is very nice and Helpful free fast internet i liked the drinking water machine in my room which gives u cold and warm water
Good Value of money in orchard SIngapore,Date of stay: December 2016,40,"The second time I stay at the hotel chancellor ( 2 - 24 Dec 2016 ). the room was small for a family with two children under five, but quite comfortable and clean. hotel staff friendly enough. Full breakfast selection is quite diverse, and very crowded at breakfast, not a comfortable place to relax at breakfast time in this hotel. so I recommend for breakfast quickly. The position of the hotel is in the orchard area with affordable price was our main reason for staying at this hotel. close to places to eat kosher, and not far to the mall in the area of the orchard, the nearest mall is the orchard and the orchard gateaway and orchard points. The hotel is not too far from Dhoby Ghaut MRT and somerset so it was also very very important points us in choosing a hotel in Singapore. Yes we're gonna stay here again for the 3rd time if we go to the singapore."
Good value of money!,Date of stay: December 2016,50,"This hotel surpassingly good! The staff are very nice and helpful. The room is clean and have free fast internet! This hotel is absolutely bargain with the good location at orchard road, easy access to go anywhere, and good room with a good view!"
Excellent location!,Date of stay: December 2016,40,"6 night stay at this 4 star property - Overall good experience. Room and bathroom were clean and well maintained. Good wifi connection in the room. We had booked the Premier room and faced no difficulty. Breakfast can have some more vegetarian options. Its very strategically located to the MRT and Bust stop thus making commuting easier for tourists. Sommerset mall, orchard central are at a walking distance. 3-4 spas around the area. 7-11 is also at walking distance."
Overpriced! Not worth it by a long shot!,Date of stay: November 2016,10,This staff was down right rude. The rooms are pokey and did not smell good. Even breakfast is nothing to write home about. I loved Singapore but this place is certainly not worth the price. Many nicer places around for a lot less. Just do your homework.
Poor service - both Front office and Coffe shop,Date of stay: November 2016,30,"I was really disappointed about this hotel services, both front office (took over 10 minutes for my check-in) & restaurant staff was very lay back and no passion at all, perhaps hotel received many Asia group, I saw many Vietnam and Korean during my stay, those are inexperience travelers cause a lots of trouble to the hotel, which made staff became very inpatient in services. Hotel hardware is fine and location is next to Orchard road (but we required to pay extra charge as with CBD area). No interest to stay or recommend friend to this hotel."
"Small, needs updating",Date of stay: November 2016,30,"Staff friendly, bed was nice and compfy. However, room was very tired, and needing refreshing. Room was very small.. Typical hotel style room, small and compact. only stay 2 nights, so was ok for a quick stay, but have stayed more modern places for similar price. Close to orchard and transport which was good. Pool was awesome on roof, no view, but big and clean"
Great Location,Date of stay: November 2016,40,"Only a very short walk from Orchard road, handy to the Singapore Airlines hop on hop off service at Orchard Parade stop, handy to MTR as well. Rooms are a bit small for a long stay, but I would stay here if only for the location. Good buffet breakfast too."
Nice homely hotel with affable staff,Date of stay: November 2016,50,"This is the third time I stayed at this property. Conveniently located. Decent sized rooms and amenities. Good Wi-Fi in rooms, clean and neat. Good Housekeeping. Front desk very helpful and cooperative, especially Ms Constantine."
Nice location with highest level of professionalism,Date of stay: October 2016,30,"Location is good however the places of attractions are not nearby, the nearest MRT is Summerset. This property is modern.. Rooms are small but neat and clean and with all the necessary amenities.. Breakfast is wide... Overall good hotel. Staffs need to be more friendly and helpful. A smiling face can bring down the blood pressure of both the end - host & guest.."
Great location,Date of stay: November 2016,40,"It's value for the price. We got the basics, which was important - a clean bathroom (it even had a bath tub), hot shower, airconditioning and most important of all - great location. It's centrally located - close to Somerset station. You can also walk to Dhoby Ghaut station. From the airport, we just took the train to Somerset, and with our luggage, it was an easy walk to the hotel. It's behind Hotel Concorde, in the middle of so many malls. There were lots of people in the lobby all the time - it was a circus. But check in was easy, i just gave my name and they had the agoda booking already in their computer. No complaints."
Excellent rooms!,Date of stay: October 2016,50,"Just renovated about two years ago, this hotel doesn't have a grand foyer entrance but the rooms are spacious enough, clean and new. Impressed with the drink water system they have installed in the rooms, it do away with the need to boil water from a kettle. Bath rooms are spacious enough. Staff were very helpful.. Thank you to front desk manager Lisa who helped us out on our change to a double bed."
Acceptable for the price,Date of stay: July 2016,30,The hotel was worth the money we paid. The staff was always helpful. They could improve the lobby area where we found ourselves swamped with tourists alighting from tour buses. The neighborhood around isn't that friendly during the late hours of the day. One of the best things about the hotel is it's location. Very convenient near the Orchid road and short walk away from the MRT.
Sweet and relaxed stay in Hotel Cancellor,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Receptionist in the Lobby named LINA was so accommodating and she always smile. She provided our needs during our stay there. Room is clean and the water dispenser helped us a lot. Location is near to Orchard and there is a hawker near the hotel. WIFI is working perfectly.
Handy place to stay,Date of stay: October 2016,30,The hotel is in a handy location near one end of the shopping area of Orchard road. A short walk gets you right into the heart of the many huge department stores that occupy the area. The information centre with its very friendly and helpful staff is a block away with bus stops close by. The Douby Gaut railway interchange is another short walk in the other direction from where you can catch trains to all parts of the city.  Our room was small but clean and comfortable. The roof top pool was used twice a day. Staff were pleasant especially the lovely Constantine who gave us some very helpful suggestions about where to eat.
A Shock for Singapore,Date of stay: September 2016,20,"I have visited Singapore many times, this was my first time at the Chancellor, The family booked three rooms. On arrival the foyer smelt very strongly of cigarette smoke, I was told it was probably the staff had been smoking on their break and had not freshened up! The room was small which tends to be a trend in Singapore, very uninteresting. I asked could I be moved to a better room, the duty manager, even though there were obviously rooms available and I was willing to pay said 'No'. Two of the rooms booked by family had cockroaches I know these are common in hot climates but never in hotel rooms. The breakfast was very cafeteria style. The staff at breakfast were very indifferent boarding on rude."
:^/,Date of stay: October 2016,20,"A decent hotel for those on a budget, but my suggestion for those who want to be assured of their sanitation should just stay somewhere else. The location is really good, props. Other than that, it's pretty much a landslide from there. Firstly, checking in took almost an hour for some reason, I suppose their system is unorganized because it took forever just check in. The lady at the front desk was nice with booking us 'premier rooms', till we actually got inside one. Once we were able to get into our room, we were greeted by some friendly cockroaches found in our bathroom and wall. Truly amazing. We requested to move rooms, and they apologized and said they'd provide free breakfast. Another thing, even if I'd ask them to clean the room, there seems to be some repellent in the bathrooms because they never cleaned it properly other than replenishing amenities. It's a dead giveaway if I can still see my hair in the tub, y'all ain't foolin' anyone. In conclusion, you pay the price and it was alright; however, I don't think I'd come back or suggest this place to anyone. All negativities aside, this place has a lot of potential, I anticipate it's growth in the future."
Suite My Needs,Date of stay: October 2016,50,"I've attended a Seminar in Holiday Inn but stayed in this hotel because of Budget. Its a great place & very near to it. Awesome. The Hotel was nice, cosy & simple. There's a nearby eateries nearby & 7-eleven in walking distance. The reception was ok & the concierge was very friendly.  The room & bed was comfortable. The wifi was excellent & its FREE. Definitely among my choice in the near future."
Pleasant and Convenient,Date of stay: October 2016,40,Stayed two nights as part of stop over on return flight to Australia as part of strategy to reduce jet lag! Due to our flight being reacheduled to earlier departure time we arrived in Singapore at 6am not 12am. We were absolutely delighted when hotel staff offered us early book in on arrival at 7am - yes we had to take twin room not a double but any bed was acceptable to us. And hotel also obligingly gave us a late (5pm) check out. Room size was not excessive but reasonable for use by 2 persons. Bathroom was excellent. Breakfast was nothing special and some dishes could have done with little bit more heat .. but have had far worse breakfast experiences. Ĺocation near Orchard Street shops is a plus however the same goods are usually available in other shopping precincts in Singapore with a lower price tag. Aĺl up though the management/staff of the hotel do a great job.
Acceptable,Date of stay: October 2016,30,"The hotel has a good location, very centric and many shops, massive shopping center and by the tub station. When we opened the room door the atmosphere was too humid and a bit smelly as the room didn't have windows... (it was lighter with a 'glass' which was the whole wall, but u couldn't get fresh air) Breakfast ok.. but missing meats or cheese, variety of milks maybe.. (skimmed, soya??).. the staff was kind and the place was clean."
good location but needs some TLC,Date of stay: October 2016,30,breakfast was very disappointing.most of the hot options were cold when there was any in the containers!The staff showed very little interest in providing any assistance or help.We ended up having rolls and butter orange juice and coffee for which we were charged 47 s/dollars for the two of us!Go outside the Hotel as there are plenty of good reasonable places very close. the room was ok but the rooftop pool and terrace needs improving
3nights on way to Vietnam,Date of stay: September 2016,30,Great location. Lots of cheap restaurants close by. A few more expensive also close by. If you like hawker food one right next door. Orchard road and Somerset MRT very close. Hotel recently refurbished. Rooms clean but no drawers for clothes. Nice big pool. Self service laundrette perfect if going on further and needin clean clothes. One restaurant but no bar. But hawker centre next door has Tiger beer fairly cheap
A maligned hotel that deserves better reviews,Date of stay: October 2016,40,This was a good clean hotel with efficient service and decent service. Maybe the staff could be more smiley and warm. Food is quite okay. Location is superb.Sound insulation good. Of course most Singapore hotels are good.
Do not stay here! Horrible experience.,Date of stay: August 2016,10,"Worst place we have ever stayed! Staff were unprofessional rude and unhelpful. Toilets leaked, rooms dirty, tv didn't work. We were moved twice. Staff slept in stairwell on breaks. Very disappointing."
Pathetic customer service though property is good,Date of stay: October 2016,10,"HOTEL DUTY MANAGER WANTS US TO PAY FOR A BROKEN SHOWER WHICH WAS REPORTED BY US TO HOTEL AS WATER WAS JUST FALLING FROM SHOWER.  I stayed in this hotel as part of our tour group. We reached hotel at 4:00 pm local time and were expected to leave for Santosa by 4:30 pm so we hurriedly left the room after securing our luggage. We returned back late in the night after dinner and were exhausted by the end of the day (we tranvelled from KL to Singapore by land) so we crashed on our beds immediately.  Next day morning we realized that hand shower in bathroom was having some issue (we used the overhead shower) so we reported the same on the reception while going out to Universal and they told us that it would be taken care.  We again returned late after dinner to realize that shower is still not done so checked with them and were promptly informed that we do not take up any work in the room in absence of guests. So I asked them to send someone at that hour and a technician came at 11 pm to check and determined that shower is broken from inside and would need a replacement. He mentioned that he will check if he has one in stock and would replace....never happened.  Next day I again informed the hotel and they sent a technician again who checked and removed the shower and took along with him to get a replacement. We called multiple times to check if he is going to come to replace it as we were planning to go out and I did not wanted to be sitting in the room waiting for technician to come (technicians do not take up repair work in absence of guests ...lol), they finally told us that we can go out and technician would come and repair. We came back in the night and still it was not fixed...I WENT TO THE FRONT DESK AND WAS GREETED BY THE DUTY MANAGER WHO STARTED BLAMING ME FOR THE BROKEN SHOWER AND TOLD ME THAT WE HAVE TO BEAR THE COST OF SHOWER AS WE DID NOT REPORT THE MATTER ON THE DAY OF ARRIVAL. I explained him that we had come in late and were hardly available to check and report on day 1....BUT HE WAS ADAMANT THAT ROOM WAS ALL FINE AND WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT AS IT WAS NOT REPORTED ON ARRIVAL BY US.  They have not replaced/repaired the shower and we are made to use the overhead shower only. No follow ups and no information from hotel on what is being done to determine what had happened."
Centrally located,Date of stay: October 2016,40,"Stayed in a triple bed room for 03 nights while our pleasure trip to Singapore. The room was tastefully decorated with effective central air conditioning. The hot water supply was available round the clock. The breakfast was served at the 2nd.level having adequate capacity to accommodate about 200 guests at a time. Water dispenser is provided in the rooms with adequate pouches of tea/coffee & sugar. House keeping was good. You have an access to many eateries, money changers, massage parlors, ATM etc. within close access. Recommended to stay with family."
Value for money on orchard road.,Date of stay: October 2016,30,"This hotel is about 1,5 years old. Parking is at the basement n they charged S$10 per day, 11pm cutoff. The reception helped to ensure we only paid for one night parking. The room was modern n clean. Firm mattress and clean bathroom with the unnecessary bath tub. I would be happy with just a shower cubicle. They provided simple amenities and water n coffee n tea. Wifi is free. TV channels are limited. Location - perfect. We could walk along orchard road to scotts road within 25 mins.  Not a bad choice and I can stay here again."
So so hotel,Date of stay: November 2015,30,Location is a good point yet the operation side is not very impressive. It takes quite long to check in. Quite crowded at the restaurant in the morning and food range is quite poor. Overall is ok. Good for those want to stay in a hotel near centre area.
Comfortable stay,Date of stay: October 2016,40,"Booked this hotel because it is located in orchard area during a 20 hour layover flight with a colleague. Taxi was able to locate the area easily, cost sgd25 from airport and travel time was about 20 minutes (plane arrived at Singapore around 10:30pm). Checking in was fast and without problems. Hallways had a faint musty smell but our room did not. Room was fairly clean. Our sink was clogged when we tried to use it but maintenance staff arrived to fix it a few minutes after we called. Wifi was fast and accessible within the hotel. We were assigned a room facing foliage and did not have problems with noise. Checking out also went smoothly. Can't comment on the quality of breakfast as it was not included in our booking."
CLOSE TO SHOPS BUT THAT'S ALL,Date of stay: September 2016,20,"THUMBS UP TO LOUIS LIM (Bell Hop) for his lovely customer service and friendliness, all the other staff were extremely unhelpful with absolutely no idea about customer service, especially in the café/restaurant. Room very average and smelt. Never again."
Excellent hotel,Date of stay: August 2016,50,"This hotel is situated right near the main shopping area with lots of restaurants and shopping malls handy. The hotel has very good staff who are really good at their job with nothing being too much trouble. The rooms are great, well sized and clean. We would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Singapore for a holiday. The tour companies all pick up and drop of to the hotel and there is a tour sales person stationed at the hotel."
OK,Date of stay: September 2016,40,"Must confess a nice hotel, no bar, a bit soul less but cannot fault the service at all, always busy with a small restaurant .  Very central with lots going on around the area, I would be happy to stay there again"
"Excellent location, clean basic accommodation",Date of stay: September 2016,30,"I spent two nights in Singapore en route from New Zealand to Europe and this hotel was perfectly adequate for the purpose. It is in an excellent location handy to Orchard Road, shopping and the MRT. The room was clean and tidy, though the unusual arrangement of the en suite with glass windows was a bit offputting. It wasn't all that privare when using the bathroom. There was a very good breakfast included in the price. The staff were helpful and courteous."
Centrally Located,Date of stay: September 2016,40,"Convenient location at the heart of Orchard Road, approx 10 mins walk to Ochard MRT Station with reasonable price.  Room are clean and comfy. And it is easy to fi d food from food courts to fine restaurant."
F1,Date of stay: September 2016,40,"Clean quiet central location great pool. central to shops, business hub, bars and restaurants. pool is located on the roof offering relaxing and ability to do laps at about 15-20m. lobby has easy access for cabs and pickup / drop off approximately 20-30min from airport"
Friendly service,Date of stay: September 2016,30,"Friendly service, hotel located on good location, decent room.  However found some cockroaches in the bathroom. yuck . Made me want to double check everything I was using in the room.  Overall impression of this hotel is positive though."
OKAY HOTEL FOR A SHORT STAY,Date of stay: September 2016,40,Stayed here for two days and it wasnt a the best hotel for the money paid i stayed with my friend and bathrooms did not have a lock just a shower curtain  room was small okay distance to shopping malls at orchard road did not have time to interact with staff
Close but no Cigar,Date of stay: September 2016,30,"Little travelers tip: Always whip out some antibacterial wipes, and wipe down the room i.e. door handles, light switches, tables, bathroom sink/bench etc. if you don't want to fall sick during your stay. Especially if you are travelling with children and infants.  Overall Summary: Okay place to stay. Confusing at first as the address says Cavenagh Rd, when it's off Kramat Ln.  If you are not a fussy guest with minimal allergens to dust mites, and enjoy seeing the reception staff to keep reactivating your lift/room key, look no further.  If you are a keen foot falcon, a nice 8 to 10 minute stroll to the Singapore Art Museum on Bras Basah Rd, heading towards Raffles City, which is literally a further 5 odd minutes away. Or you might as well go all the way down and reach Suntec City. Or swing a left onto Victoria St off Bras Basah Rd, and potter along for another 5 to 10 minutes to reach Bugis shopping area.  Room hygiene readiness is not ideal, unless we lucked out. Our lift and room key kept failing. Carpets not vacuumed properly. Bathroom and shower floors had hair piles left in corners. Bathroom walls had gunk and splash stains (brown) this was evident once you shut the bathroom door behind you. Bathroom door seal is coming off. Corridor walls had what looked like drink/coffee splash stains. Bed sheets had previous guest hairs. I think they may have done a quick dust down, not actually changing the sheets?  Pros: Good walking distance to either Somerset or Dohby Ghaut MRTs to take you on an adventure time. Orchard shopping strip literally a 30 second walk away. If you are feeling peckish, a mini food hawker stalls is a 30 second walk towards Orchard Rd.  Cons: Room hygiene is not great Lift/room key kept failing General requested room service a little slow (forgiven as we are patient guests)  Expensive accommodation for an average stay. Room for improvements I say."
A great stay with Family,Date of stay: August 2016,40,The hotel is located on the beautiful Orchard road near the Dhobighat station surrounded by greenery. excellent location and some good shops nearby for buying T shirts and other souvenirs. Hotel break fast was not up to the mark. Too many travel groups make the place really crowded.
"Clean, tidy, and comfortable.",Date of stay: August 2016,50,"This stay was very nice, hotel was great, staff reasonably friendly on reception, the house maids were efficient and obliging, especially the little lady on morning duty in the breakfast room... She worked very hard. The breakfasts were really tasty. The pool was great during the day to take a midday swim to cool off. The only negative (and it has nothing to do with the staff or hotel) was the blatant stealing of plates of fruit and other food each morning which was coveted under Black fabric by women wearing Burqas. Thank you for a very enjoyable stay!!!"
stop over,Date of stay: August 2016,40,"Book through SQ stop over which included airport transfer. Hotel is just okay especially for a night. Room size reasonable. Service is good, but a lot of asian people that need to learn to queue up. Location is good, shopping and food stalls across the road."
Lovely stay,Date of stay: August 2016,40,"Stayed here for afew nights to break our trip up. Very friendly and helpful staff room was really nice and modern. WiFi great. A little store on ground floor for souvenirs, chemist items and snacks great idea. Restaurant food is good. Nice and central great for hop on hop off bus. Gentleman on info desk was super helpful he organised everything for us. Thankyou for our stay"
Good location that's all,Date of stay: August 2016,30,Booked through Singapore Airlines stopover holidays. Obviously a budget tourist hotel good value esp when airport transfers are included both ways. Near to shopping centres and food. Don't expect any service so you won't be disappointed. Just a place to break the journey. Don't bother about paying for hotel brekky. Plenty of food outlets across the street shopping centre.
Good location,Date of stay: August 2016,30,Not far from orchard station (but actually it's the other side of somerst station. So it's close to somerset mrt station. The rooms are clean and look quite new. A bit pricey but it seem all singapore hotels are. Staff were friendly
"Not too bad, but room for improvement",Date of stay: August 2016,30,"Staff are attentive and friendly. Location is very convenient, a lot shops and restaurants just around the corner. Breakfast was just so so. I admitted that we requested rooms that away from elevators, but we didn't expect THAT FAR.. 😬"
Disappointing,Date of stay: August 2016,20,"I had booked this hotel on booking.com as I usually would do for ease. My booking stated that no deposit would be taken yet on arrival I was arrives that the first night cost was taken from my card! According to him, this is usual protocol for all guests. This is fraud. I wanted to pay by cash on arrival.  After about 40mins of trying to get some idiot about the desk to understand his mistake and realise that his actions were in fact illegal, a young guy (Jonathan, who was actually very helpful) had suggested getting the manager for assistance.  The manger, John Lee, came to the front desk and had admitted that his colleague had made a vital error and had debited my account without consent. He extended his apologies and offered to refund the amount...this took sound 5-10mins.  On eventually checking into the room, the door didn't lock from the inside and the bathroom door had no lock on it at all. This is pretty basic...especially as it is a ""3 star"" hotel. I called The front desk and they sent up a handyman who told me he couldn't fix it and would be back tomorrow. Haha, no! I went back down to the front desk and demanded a new room, where John came out and took control of the situation.  New room was fine, however, 90 mins after I arrived I could relax...this is too long!  We've still 2 nights left so can't comment on breakfast but from the reviews it's nothing to be blown away by. The pool is decent up on the roof. There are plenty of eateries minutes from the hotel and if you hop on the underground you can go to Clarke Quay, Chinatown, and Little India for food.  This hotel, is a 2 star. ;)"
My second visit deducts a star.,Date of stay: May 2016,30,"OVERVIEW :  This is my 2nd review of my 2nd stay and unfortunately i had to take one star away due to poor housekeeping and too much tourist group noise.  PROS :  + Check-In & Check-Out process is quite fast, but do note the tall fair lady with short hair was quite nervous and keep forgetting stuff (and her English need a bit of improvement)  + Place is considerably close to the heart of Orchard (Nge Ann City), around 15-20 mins walk.  + Quite Close to Somerset MRT, around 7-10 mins walk  + Quite a bargain for 3.5 stars hotel (in Orchard area that is) PS : My previous review stated it was 4 stars, actually it's not.  + Two Mode Shower, the usual spray and the ceiling rain.  + Non Refillable Soap Dispenser, means unlimited hygenic liquid soap. (But might be cons, if you like to keep hotel's soap bottle as souvenir.)  + They got built in Drinking Water Filter, with Cold, Normal and Hot (with safety lock), which practically remove the unsavoury taste of tap water.  CONS :  - Tourist Group can be quite noisy, and they had plenty of it.  - TV is digital, however is quite often laggy and stutter, and worst is the clicky sound.  - The place is rather secluded, all the taxis i rode (except one out of tens) don't have the clue where the hotel is.  - WiFi is 100 MB at 1Mbps (Capped both upload & download speed). Unlimited capped 10mbps is a better sense.  - Breakfast quality is decent, but need a bit more variety though. People who stay more than 3 days, probably can't stand the same items. (PS: they're all continental breakfast, except for the steamed buns)  - Room is quite clean, but a rather poor house keeping start to be seen on my 2nd visit : # molds in the shower room # sticky liquid marks on parts of the room by previous visitor didn't get cleaned even after twice housekeeping. # no tissue given on my 2nd day, and when i asked for it, after waiting for 30mins, they gave me a unsightly stained tissue box. When i try to catch the guy who sent the box (because i saw he brought two boxes) he left for the lift, despite he has sight on and heard me calling for him.  - no secure lock for discreetly opening the door (meaning you can't open the door, without safely prevents stranger from breaking through in)  CORRECTION : * Correcting on a claim by other family members who had different room in my first visit : despite some room are smaller they do have the red high chair as well as hair dryer."
Orchard nightmare.,Date of stay: August 2016,20,"This hotel does not provide face cloths. They do not provide towels by the swimming pools. Breakfast is mediocre to say the best. Poor selection or choice, does not cater very well, and the food is often cool/cold. The scrambled egg looked reconstituted and very watery. There is no selection for fried or poached egg, omlets nonexistent, and no bacon. The rooms are small with only one bedside cabinet provided. There were no movie selections on the television. The bed however was comfortable. There appears to be a general lack of staff."
Great for a hotel on the cheaper side.,Date of stay: August 2016,40,"My partner and I stayed 8 nights here, staff were very welcoming on arrival and checkout was pretty quick and efficient. The lobby is often full from big tour groups etc but wasn't a big deal. The room was quite a decent size for the two of us it was plenty big enough. The room did have a damp smelly odour though which was a little bit uncomfortable, the bathroom had a bath shower in one which I wasn't a fan of, it was very awkward to get in and out of. It is located very close to two MRT stations and all you can need along Orchard road, the visitor centre is also only a 10minute walk from the hotel, they were great with any questions we had."
Good value option for location,Date of stay: July 2016,40,"Clean and comfortable hotel in Orchard Road. Staff friendly and efficient at check in and check out. Popular with big tour groups which, shall we say, sometimes puts a strain on space in the breakfast restaurant and foyer. Some days they separated the tour groups from the “real‘ guests at breakfast, which frankly is a good thing, I have never seen people actually fight over a chicken chipolata before. Pool was quite nice and strangely nearly always empty; perhaps the tour groups have no energy left after their breakfast skirmish. Rooms somewhat warmer than I would have wanted. I like to have control over my own air con, thank you, rather than a box on the wall which appears to give me control but is in fact centrally controlled. Each room has an utterly superfluous hot and cold water dispensing thingy. What I say is wrong with a kettle? Oh and why do hotels insist on having partly frosted glass walls between the bathroom and the bedroom these days? I don’t know about others, but my showering experience is not enhanced by looking out at my travelling companion watching the telly."
This is a really dissapointing place to stay,Date of stay: July 2016,10,"I must admit I had reservations about this place as soon as I saw the grubby stained settees in the reception area. Why wouldn't management replace or clean them? I think they don't because they just don't care. There seems to be many loud pushy travelers that stay here so I guess they are happy just taking a dollar or two of those that are prepared to stay in a dump. We were ooked in by our travel agent who had stayed there before but I suspect they put sellers in nice rooms and the rest of us get what is left. We were supposed to get a double room but were first sent to a twin. When we did get to stay in the room it was a total dissapointment. I thought the compendium on the TV was good but the browser that was provided on it didn't work. The water dispenser was also a good feature. That was the total good things. The rest is a fail. The coffee cups were stained, the sealant in the bathroom was mouldy, There were no flannels. The mirror in the bathroom was only cleaned as far as they could reach. The skirting boards around the walls were falling off. There was exposed electrical wiring beside the beds. The housekeeping was poor with debris behind the single chair and under the bed. The rooms are also quite small. This hotel is very badly worn and I think it probably suffers from a shonky rebuild. We ended up with this through a Singapore Airlines Square deal package. This experience has put me right of Singapore Airlines. Management at this hotel need to sort the place out. We left after the first night and got a really nice hotel for not much more. I would upload photo's but I think it would spoil the folders containing nice photo's that other people have put up. A 1 star hotel I think!"
My husband and I had a 4 day stay here.,Date of stay: June 2016,30,"The hotel room was neat and cleaned daily. However, there was no tea/coffee facilities. Our view from the 7th floor was amazing. The breakfast was sufficient. This hotel is situated close to Orchard Road, which is the main road, that leads to everything. Shopping is amazing along Orchard Road."
"Very good hotel, great location",Date of stay: February 2016,40,"The hotel offers very good facilities and is very centrally located, especially if you are interested in shopping. But even the main attractions are all very nearby. It has a beautiful swimming pool on the roof and a good, but more expensive restaurant..."
Comfortable Stay,Date of stay: April 2016,40,"My stay in this hotel was very comfortable. The size of the room was comfortable and was clean. The room rates are reasonable and the staff is helpful and efficient. I was given a room with a nice view. The location of the hotel is excellent on Orchard Road. The malls, metro, restaurants are all close by. So there are no problem for commuting, eating or shopping."
Everything is average,Date of stay: July 2016,30,"The only thing i like this hotel is it situates nearby Orchard road, very convenience to shopping area and MRT. Apart from that, this hotel is just so-so if you are not expecting too much. My room has not been cleaned when i backed to the hotel before 4pm at least twice. Simple and average breakfast. A lot of group tours that cause the lobby over-crowded. Service is slow in general.."
Worst Hotel we have ever stayed at.,Date of stay: July 2016,10,"We arrive late on the 22/07/2016 and as a part of a Singapore Airlines package we were taken to Hotel Chancellor at Orchard. Looked OK from the outside and that is where it finished. When we got to our room one of the beds had been used and had not been made up. As a couple been given a twin room this was not good on top of the other issue. As we had arrived with friends we went straight to see them. We were not happy with the standard of this property so we when down to reception and under sufferance both given new rooms they where not much better. We stay the night but after seeing more alarming issues like our bathroom being flooded by the toilet, skirting's falling off, live wiring under the beside cabinets terminated in strip connectors, very poor housekeeping standards, marks over all the walls in the room and everywhere you looked. We went back to reception to discuss the matters and we where told the maintenance man would come and fix the toilet. This was being marketed as a nearly new property but found out it had had a very poor standard refurbish about a year ago. Shame on you Singapore Airlines using this rubbish accommodation shame on you Hotel Chancellor at Orchard for thinking this is OK. We at this stage called our Travel agent and told him to find a decedent Hotel. We had a Hotel Security man sent to see us to discuss our issues and were then called by the Hotel Manager offering a better room (over the phone) what a great way to deal with issues.This was really not as good as a new backpackers that we looked at in Cambodia. This is a very poor standard property and we were only there because of Singapore Airlines. We had not looked hard at this property because it was part of the Singapore Airlines package. Never stay at this property!!!!! This nearly put us off Singapore but finished our stay at Jen Hotel Tanglin which was great."
Looks good on the surface but there are problems,Date of stay: July 2016,20,"Convenient location and the room was comfortable and modern but I struggled to get toilet paper (none at all in the room when I arrived and only part rolls supplied on request) and wet towels replaced. The lobby is also incredibly noisy and makes it difficult to communicate with the reception staff. Be very cautious about handing over the supposedly refundable $50.00 that is requested on arrival. I unwisely handed it over in cash and was not given a receipt. When I asked about the refund on checking out it had never been recorded as being paid and supervisory staff became very defensive when I tried to resolve this, without success. I would not use this hotel again."
Comfortable and Convenient Location,Date of stay: July 2016,40,This hotel was very clean and comfortable. I thought the room was a good size and we got an excellent deal on it. I really appreciate that they offer a water filter instead of bottled water in the room. The bathroom was spacious.
Mohsin,Date of stay: July 2016,30,Good location Friendly staff Clean and best hotel to stay and best rates I think quick response to your query metro transit is near eating area malls are near and what do you want your are at orchard road
Average hotel in Orchard vicinity,Date of stay: June 2016,30,"Stayed 3N in June 2016.  Pros: 1. Location is near Somerset and Dhoby Ghaut stations 2. My room was spacious, and quiet for the 3 nights (high floor) 3. Drinking water filter in room 4. I was able to check in/out in minutes  Cons: 1. Average cleanliness 2. Lobby can get noisy/crowded when the group tours check in/out"
BAD TIMING,Date of stay: July 2016,20,"I did not realize that I was arriving during a major Singapore holiday. The Hotel rates were outrageous! Due to the high room rates, I was compelled to share a tiny room with twin beds. There was barely room for the luggage. The restaurants also raised their rates. This is my last trip to Singapore."
"Convenient, if nothing much else",Date of stay: December 2015,30,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 days in December 2015 (I know I know the review is late). The hotel is situated at the commencement of the famous Orchard road and this thus very convenient. MRT stations are walking distance adding to the convenience factor. The hotel itself is pretty average. On the plus side, it is modern and clean and the rooms have all the necessary facilities. On the negative side, the rooms are tiny, the staff is unfriendly, bordering on rude, and the breakfast buffet sucks. What you do get I suppose for the price you pay is for a reasonably comfortable place to rest your head at the end of a long touristy day. Skip the breakfast."
Disappointed Experiences,Date of stay: July 2016,20,"If you are looking for just a place to drop your bags and a bed to sleep in than this is fine. Me and 2 of my friends booked this hotel because it was highly recommended due to it being 4 stars.  However we were very disappointed and here is why :  1) The Bell Hopper person took our luggage up stairs and just stand in our room randomly waiting for tips when it actually should be part of their services. He didn't even help us get a taxi to the airport!  2) There isn't enough space for us (3ppl) to move around in, and that includes not enough space for our luggages.  3) The air condition can only go down to 22 degrees not any lower! The maintenance staff couldn't give me a answer as too why!  4) No spoons or folks in the draw so you have to get some yourself  5) There no bathrobes or slippers when there suppose to be.  6) Cleaning was average, we stayed for 7days, and not once did they changed the bed sheets. It not very hygienic! This make me question their cleaning method  Overall, I wouldn't go back to this hotel again. Definitely the one in New Zealand offered a better services."
Do not spend any night at all at this hotel,Date of stay: July 2016,10,"Considered yourself warned. 1) Very hostile, unfriendly and unhelpful front staff. They give you very standard common sense responses to every query you asked, and no solution provided. They just left you hanging there, to just deal with it. 2) The room is small (bearable considering SG is a small country). But what made it worse is the bad noise insulation...between rooms and the corridors. Every conversation at above whisper level will be heard, every footsteps too. The most dreadful part is the pub music in the middle of the night! Boom boom boom till u can't even get a shut eye, even on the higher floor. Hence what's the point paying for hotel when you can even have a good night of sleep. When you speak to the front desk, their response was ""yes, because we are in the city, bound to have noise. Sorry, can't change your room because our hotel is fully booked'. It's surprising that such lousy hotel is fully booked! I guess it's booked mainly by huge commercial tour groups on budget.  Bad bad bad, avoid at all cost."
Average Hotel @ star category,Date of stay: May 2016,30,"Check in is always difficult at this hotel, takes a lot of time. Rooms are ok, not anything impressive. is only good if you get at cheap rates and have no biggi expectations from hotel. location is convenient. there are good places outside where you can eat or relax."
family holidays in Singapore - Average,Date of stay: June 2016,30,"it was a family holiday during summer vacations. The hotel was booked by tour operator Tourland but nothing special in the hotel. Inexpert staff boring , sad and dry. Normal check in. breakfast average . far away from all major attractions of the city.Rooms are also small in size, average cleanliness , lobby also non - impressive.Average toiletry. pool is also average."
Decent for the price,Date of stay: June 2016,40,I had to find accommodation in singapore for 2 days and after a Internet search decided to stay here... the main advantage of the hotel is the location.. very central to all the shopping areas.. most are walking distance.. The room was relatively spacious and had all what u need.. and WiFi was free which was fabulous.. overall it was a very pleasant stay..and the staff was very nice.. highly recommend...
Ok for the price compared to other hotels in Singapore.,Date of stay: July 2016,30,"Everything is clean and looks new. Rooms are relatively small but clean. There is no mini bar (there is a fridge) and our hot water dispenser only output tepid water; far too cold to make coffee or tea. The pool is excellent. Breakfast is basic but adequate. Location is not the easiest to find. This hotel is NOT on Orchard Rd, it is well hidden in an alley. However it IS reasonably central with MRT access about 450m away. The lobby is small and there are no amenities except a small market style stall with limited opening hours. If you are on a budget this is fine."
worst hospitality ever experienced,Date of stay: June 2016,10,"We had gone on 5D/4N trip to singapore with family (4 adults and one infant). After waiting for hours in their lobby they offered us twin bed (two seperate beds) rooms which is definitely unsafe when we are having one infant with us. On requesting/complaining they kept saying that queen beds are available only if available. Later the staff at desk started talking very rudely and asked for more money if we wanted to have rooms with queen size beds. Considering my situation in a foreign nation I ended up paying extra 94 S$ for each room. There were many vegetarians staying in the hotel, but offerings in breakfast were very limited and repeated all four days wihout any display whether its vegetarian or not. I would not recomment anyone to stay in this hotel. I felt that the enitre hotel staff had to take hospitality training. Worst experience at hight cost !"
loud dance music at 3.45 a.m,Date of stay: June 2016,10,"Cant belive i am on the 10th floor and cannot get a wink of sleep! The dance music has been playing since around 11am tonight, it us now 3.45 a,m and its not from another room, there is either a nearby club or this hotel has a club on one if the levels. There is no information in the room about how you can contact the front desk etc, jyst what you need after a very long u.k flight."
Grand Chancellor is not Grand,Date of stay: June 2016,30,"I stayed in Hotel Grand Chancellor with my family at Orchard for 5 days with great expectations. But,in reality, the situation was different. The restaurant was at 2nd floor with 2 big halls. Morning breakfast was from 7am to 9.30am which was complementary. But, to my surprise, the restaurant staff was cooperative but inadequate. They were unable to manage the huge crowd during breakfast. All the tables were full of eaten dishes & no clean up by staff. There was a shortage of forks, eating items,glasses, tissues, the list goes on. There was no staff for clean up & replenishment of the items. No sitting place found during peak period. Hence the experience was pathetic. Wi-fi is charged exorbitantly @ 9 SGD per day.Only first 50MB was free. There are some basic flaws in bathroom design. There is only half partition for shower which results in water spray across basin & mirror. No proper thinking is done to keep the towels at the right place. Food for veggies is a challenge & you get only veg platter @ 17 SGD . Overall only advantage to have location at Orchard or else not recommended for stay."
Disappointing,Date of stay: June 2016,10,"Good location? Yes. But receptionist and restaurant staff are rude. SMALL ROOM for TRIPLE BED. No toothbrush for a 4 STAR hotel,gave us only 2 towels for triple bed room,not clean enough,AC wasn't cool enough (we even slept without blanket at 20 degrees celcius),and only have a 100MB free wifi per booking transaction,NOT per day. And we stayed for 4 nights,100MB for 4 nights!!!! After that u have to pay. Also don't have many TV channel,no cartoon channel for my daughter. And SAME BREAKFAST EVERYDAY with NOT MUCH OPTIONS. I never stayed in a same hotel in 1 destination,i always try different hotel everytime i visit same destination,and this one isn't recommended at all. (Stayed from june 20th 2016 until june 24th 2016)"
Worst experience,Date of stay: October 2015,10,"Not even a one star. Worst hotel you can come across my stay in this hotel was pathetic. We took 4 rooms as we were 8 ppl all the rooms in different floor thats quite amazing, total wastage of money. Food is pathetic hotel service is pathetic they should be rated a big zero star hotel.. Staffs are very rude.. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.."
Hotel area,Date of stay: June 2016,50,"Hotel area very good and closed with bus station and M R T station , good area and love it  hotel very clear and everyone in hotel very nice and Maid very good to service too  i love this hotel and will back again :D"
Good Hotel to Stay,Date of stay: May 2016,40,Very good location. Just off Orchard Road. Rooms relatively small but Ok by Singapore standards. Breakfast venue gets very crowded during season and it takes serious effort to find seating space. Many tour operators patronize this hotel and that is the reason for the rush in the dining area. There is a 7-11 store nearby to pick up essentials. Good hot -cold drinking water arrangement equipment provided in the room.
Very bad service,Date of stay: May 2016,10,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 days 2 night. The service was worse, the room didnt clean since we found some rubish at the same place since the first day we stayed. Restaurant service is the worsed, we went there the staff didnt help when we were asking about coffee, no smile, and they stand in front of the restaurant door like security. This hotel maybe have good location as near orchad road but i will not recomend to the family traveller."
DO NOT STAY HERE ! Terrible Place,Date of stay: May 2016,10,"Do NOT stay here. You are wasting your Money ! The food will make you sick. The hotel is so UGLY ! The rooms are tiny... sooooo Tiny !  They will give you a room with 2 tiny single beds. This is a ONE STAR Hotel at best !!  We asked ""Benny"", the manager to allow us to check out a couple of days early and he refused, without reason.  The hotel staff are idiots. They didn't even have us registered after staying one night !  It is a Terrible Terrible hotel and a waste of ANY of your money.  Do Not Stay HERE !!"
Nice Hotel But Poor Facilities,Date of stay: May 2016,20,"Hotel is very well furnished and clean but rooms are too small, No services at all... We have to take our luggage by ourselves to our room.... it took too much time for check in and check out.... Hotel had swimming pool but no other facilities...we even have to take towels from your room..."
totally wastage of money & time too,Date of stay: May 2016,10,the hotel rooms & aminitiies are as poor as 1 star rated hotel. & the breakfast presentation is also not as expected..... & the wifi the written free on booking & give only 100 mb for even our 3 days stay
good value for location,Date of stay: May 2016,40,"booked this hotel for a birthday staycation for 3d2n. room is very clean and tidy when checking in, have no issue with the room size. the only bad thing is that the hotel room bathtub is a little slippery. staff is very friendly and helpful, was checking in by a chinese manager. overall a very good stay"
"Wonderful helpful staff, great location",Date of stay: April 2016,40,"Clean, functional room, close to great pubs, restaurants and shopping, only a $12 to $20 cab ride to go to Singapore Zoo or Sentosa Island. Staff very knowledgeable, obliging and helpful. Breakfast daily is plentiful with lots of choice"
One nights stay,Date of stay: May 2016,30,"Stayed one night at Hotel Chancellor @ Orchard. We are a family of 4, with two young boys of 6 and 7. The excellent: - Location; just off Orchard Road. The good: - Both late checkin 1 am and subsequent late checkout 2 pm was very flexible. - the buffet breakfast was plentiful and a satisfactory in choice, although not very extensive. We were all very happy. The not so good: - Room was booked for us through Booking.com by family, but when we arrived we were charged, as the booking payment was rejected as Amex was not accepted by the hotel; a little bit of a shock. - Very small room for 4 people; no extra space with double/queen and a single beds, but clean. - Pretty much left to manage our 2 large suitcases and 4 mid-size bags on entry and exit; not that we were too bothered.  In summary, quite a basic offering for around S$240 a night, but satisfactory and a great location."
All about location location,Date of stay: May 2016,40,"We found this hotel in a very good location for shopping eating and nightlife. Was easy to get a taxi to where ever you wanted to go. The front Desk service is very good, and the staff are very friendly. We had a twin room that was of a reasonable size,but a big problem was that there is no storage place for more than one suitcase and only hanging space in a small wardrobe no cupboards,so we lived out of our suitcases for the five nights. As this is an environment conscious hotel the cleaning was too a minimum our room was never vacuumed while we were there,and we picked up any rubbish on the floor The Breakfast that was provided with our booking was quite a good assortment of different foods.The one problem we did encounter was the rude guest on tours staying at this hotel and believe me there were lots everyday,thankfully they had a separate breakfast area. Would I stay there again ? Yes maybe at a different time of the year would be better and if we could get a room with some cupboard storage"
Take your chances @ the Chancellor,Date of stay: May 2016,20,"Very disappointing stay at what turned out to be a 3rd rate hotel with delusions of grandeur. I'll start with the good - Location, WiFi & the view over the park from our 10th floor room were great. The Bad - In our 5 night stay, the carpets in our room & the hallway were not vacuumed once.Strong smell of mildew in the room, so bad we actually bought an air freshener. Nothing in the fridge, not even a bottle of water. No cupboard or draw space for our clothes, we literally had to live out of our suitcases. Only 2 spare coathangers. Only 1 bedside table. Only 1 coffee cup provided. The Breakfast buffet was part of our deal. WORST.BREAKFAST.EVER. the only edible things were the toast & the stale cereal with room temperature milk. We did not want to risk food poisoning with the so called hot food. The small lobby was always full of Indian or Chinese tour groups making it hard to get to & from the elevators & you wouldn't let your dog sit on the seats in there either. I could go on & on but if you're still reading this & still decide to stay here... well, don't say I didn't warn ya."
Good if you don't need Wifi,Date of stay: May 2016,40,"PROS :  + Check-In & Check-Out proses is quite fast, despite seemingly only two persons working at one time  + Place is considerably close to the heart of Orchard (Nge Ann City), around 15-20 mins walk.  + Quite Close to Somerset MRT, around 7-10 mins walk  + Quite a bargain for 4 stars hotel (in Orchard area that is)  + Two Mode Shower, the usual spray and the ceiling rain.  + Non Refillable Soap Dispenser, means unlimited hygenic liquid soap. (But might be cons, if you like to keep hotel's soap bottle as souvenir.)  + They got built in Drinking Water Filter, with Cold, Normal and Hot (with safety lock), which practically remove the unsavoury taste of tap water.  Since i cant stand the taste of tap water, i actually always bought bottles of water whenever i stay at Singapore, except at this hotel ! Which is very very awesome.  Saving a lot of energy to haul bottled water, times and obviously money too.  CONS :  - The place is rather secluded, all the taxis I rides on, don't have the clue where the hotel is. In part maybe because it mentioned located at 28 Cavenagh Road, eventhough the main entrance is via Kramat Lane. (Maybe because ""Kramat"" doesnt sound too nice in the first place, it's malay for ""supernatural"")  - The worst thing beside the secluded place and misleading road's name, is ... the Internet / Wifi !!! Well you wouldn't expect a hotel in Singapore, whose country are typically ranked one of the countries faster Internet connection merely give quota 100 MB at 1Mbps (Capped up & down speed)  Unlimited capped 10mbps is a better sense.  - Breakfast quality are decent, but need a bit more variety though. People who stay more than 3 days, probably can't stand the same items. (ps: they're all continental breakfast, except for the steamed buns)  - Room is clean, but some of component installed in room is not all top grade one, for example : # found a lamp switch didnt work # it's very slow to refill the toilet tanks and it's often leaking # no secure lock for discreet opening the door (meaning you can't open the door, without safely prevents stranger from breaking through in)  SPECIAL REMARKS : * Some other family members who had different room claim tbat their room significantly smaller than mine, eventhough it's supposed to be the same class. As confirmation they don't have the red high chair as in the picture.  But I didnt had chance to photograph it, because they did check out earlied than me.  * Also their room had no hair dryer like mine."
Good hotel for a short business trip,Date of stay: April 2016,40,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in April 2016. Generally, it is acceptable. It is close to Orchard road where you can find lots of shops there. Room is small but clean and quiet. Breakfast is good with plenty of choices. They have a small souvenir shop in the hotel but little more expensive compare to Indian shop that is close."
Good stay!,Date of stay: December 2015,40,"Me and my family stayed at this hotel about long time ago which is last year, during Xmas.I love the location of the hotel, near to MRT and shopping mall.This hotel provide a comfort stay for us, and also the breakfast is good, we enjoyed the selection and quality.The front desk staff Avinisha was Very friendly and efficient staff, with her pleasant looking and smile. will stay again. :)"
Could not ask for better,Date of stay: May 2016,40,"Arrived from the airport at 9:30am, after an overnight flight. The friendly receptionist was very helpful, even writing down instructions, as the noise from tour groups in the lobby was over the top. I was given an upgraded room at no extra cost and was permitted to go straight to it at this early hour. I was also given a late check out time of 4:00pm on the day that I was leaving at no extra cost. Arriving at 7:00am for breakfast, with barely anyone else there, the staff were very helpful. The buffet had lots of variety. I could not fault it."
Was prepared for worst but pleasantly surprised,Date of stay: April 2016,50,"Ok...so had decided a Singapore Stopover was a good idea and from the list of hotels available (via Singapore Airlines package) I gave the agent our preference after reading reviews. TBH the Chancellor was not on that list, but as we needed two rooms, preferably connected, as we were travelling with our teenage daughters, we were told for our dates of travel this hotel was the only one suitable/available in our price range. Re-reading reviews did nothing to alleviate my fears so I informed family not to expect anything special.  Well, we seemed to have a completely different experience from others that have reviewed this hotel. Upon arriving after a 6am flight arrival, at around 8ish, Lisa at the front desk checked us in and informed us that fortunately our rooms were actually ready (was fully not expecting to access room until after 2pm) this was wonderful as after a 12+hr flight, no sleep and a migraine on my part, a lie down before exploring Singapore was just what we needed. I was also very pleased with our rooms, we obviously had refurbished ones as the facilities were modern and clean, no high bath or mildew smell, and bed was super comfortable. We had no issue with our room cards at all, used the roof top pool, and found all staff we encountered friendly and helpful. Granted, we had not included breakfast in our stay and did not use in house dining at all, but was only a short stroll to some great dining options. Overall our short stay (2 nights) in Singapore was an enjoyable experience, and I wouldnt hesitate to stay at the Chancellor again."
Great location with value for money,Date of stay: January 2016,30,"Hotel location is good. Near food outlets. The hotel has great location in Orchard, across from Somerset MRT Station (Mass Rapid Transit in Singapore, located under 313@Somerset Shopping Centre between Orchard Road and Somerset Road), and surrounded by food outlets and shopping districts.  Hotel is new but very simple decorated. Reception is friendly but needed to be trained English a little bit more.  Price of this hotel for a double bed was US$100 which was a good price for Orchard area hotel.  Hotel TV system lets you browse internet and we watched Youtube most of the time"
Very Disappointing,Date of stay: January 2016,20,"Stayed here in March 2016 on a trip of a lifetime to Australia. It was our first hotel of the journey and put a damper on the trip. We were very disappointed at the staff and found them sometimes down right rude. They were unorganised and didn't seem to know what was going on. Saw the Maitre de at the breakfast service clearly disgruntled with people who turned up for breakfast 15 minutes before service finished, and did not hesitate to show his irritation. Breakfast was awful, cold and very limited and half the pots were empty and not refilled. The room was in a disgusting state when we arrived with food all over the floor and plates left uncleared all over the tables. Reception was very shabby and there were not enough chairs for the amount of people who always seemed to be there. On a plus note the hotel was very convenient for the main shopping street and transport links, Think the management should have a good customer service training session!"
“Its so bad its funny...”,Date of stay: April 2016,10,"The earlier reviews are true in every respect. I will start with the only positives - hotel is 2 mins walking from MRT, and we stayed at orchard road,our room had aquaguard unlimited water. But its downhill from there...  Hotel had an overcrowded reception not because they were busy but because THERE WAS ALWAYS A PROBLEM. 1. Hotel had ancient ways ie,to see if the room is vacant staff use to run to the floors as they could not see it on the system you can the queue since for every booking they would rush 2. While doing my checkin 6 ppl came complaining room keys not working. 3. 1st hotel where dental kit and extra towels, room slippers were chargeable. 4. Extremely impolite staff with 0 hospitality especially the Manager Raymond never come across anything worse than this. 5. Let alone the early checkin we couldn't even get a room at 2 the checkin time while we were waiting since 7:30 in morning to checkin.  Yes - it is near to the MRT at orchard; but so are so many other hotels especially when you pay 190$ a night - they can't all be this bad. Seriously, do not do it; there are prisons that are luxurious by Chancellor Hotel standards.  And before you ask yourself, ""can it really be that bad?"" Trust me, yes it can."
"Great location, friendly team",Date of stay: April 2016,30,"This hotel is located within walking distance to Dhouby Gaut station and just down the Road from Singapura Plaza shopping centre. The reception was small and modern although very busy with tour groups shuffling in and out. We were checked in quickly by an efficient young man. We were not provided any information on local attractions, not that we asked. The room was a triple deluxe, small but adequate. We travelled with our adult son. The bathroom is very small and has a glass wall that has an opaque film covering it - but it is not very private when the light is on. There is a great water urn plumbed into the room - so you can get hot and cold filtered water anytime. Tea and coffee basics were available in the drawer. The lap pool on the top floor is very open, but a great relief in the very hot Singapore weather.  Breakfast was another experience all together. First morning we ate at 9 am. The place was in disarray as it appeared that bus loads of people had eaten and run and the three staff working in the dining room were completely overwhelmed. We asked for a table to be cleared so we could eat - which was done without an issue. The staff were restocking items that had run out - if there was anything missing we just asked and they got it for us. They were just extremely overworked and could have done with a couple of extra team members.  Next day we ate at 8am - all I can say is don't do it at this time - hoards of people grabbing at food like it was their last meal. Piling their plates ridiculously high. And stacking empty dishes wherever they could find a space. The poor staff could not keep up with the crowd. I would recommend eating later."
One big mess,Date of stay: April 2016,30,"Location wise this hotel is placed in a nice spot on Orchard. Its a new hotel about a year old and the rooms are clean and smart but tiny and they reminded me of budget hotel rooms in central London. The lobby is small with about 15 chairs and at any time during the day there are over 50 guests waiting to check in and there is plenty of luggage all over the place. They seem to have bulk deal arrangements and during my stay I found bus loads of students, cruise line crew (500 of them) all staying here and it was unbelievably noisy in the nights. Could not sleep as I could hear every word spoken in the corridor. The way breakfast is served is a good indication of the quality of service and attitude of most hotels. This hotel has a namesake breakfast buffet, the whole place is a mess and there is no one to clean the place up. If you are looking for an early check in, its not going to happen. Though check in is at 2 Pm the chances are you might get a room at 3 PM."
Overpriced and overrated,Date of stay: January 2016,30,We chose this hotel because it is close to the Orchard shopping centres and wanted to save... so we were punished for that. Penny wise and pound foolish. Briefly: Rooms are extremely small! Bathroom is really tiny!!! Miserable breakfast with hordes of people. Knee-deep swimming pool a the top without any service. Free wifi?! NO!!! Just 100Mb per person per stay!!!!  The only pro: It is new!
Great Location and Value for Money,Date of stay: March 2016,50,"First, Location - Orchard Road - What else do you want. Next to all the malls and shopping area just 150mts away from the hotel. - You have a Street food market next to the hotel, if you find Singapore expensive. 7/11 store right next door.  Second - Room - Small but good. Staff - Friendly Swimming Pool - Great and Food @ B/F was OK.  Negatives - -Public Area Washrooms at lobby needs to be cleaned. - No TV Channels at all - only 10 -15 Free to Air local channels.  But overall Good Value for money."
Good location and value,Date of stay: March 2016,40,"We found this hotel to be great value in a very expensive city. Stayed in a deluxe room. Room 1046. Very clean, nice crisp bedding, tea and coffee maker in room. Very quiet. Bathroom small only one person at a time but no problem. Shower over bath and quite high to step into but rails to hold onto. Toiletries provided. Position of hotel was perfect. There are outdoor eateries 50m from hotel cheap affordable street food. Close to MTR approx. 5 mins walk. Close to shopping malls. Taxi from airport cost $25SGD. Would like to make a special mention to Alvin on reception. He was very friendly and professional. Suggested things to do and places to eat. He always had a smile. There is a nice pool area on roof but did not use. There is just one criticism of this hotel and its the breakfast. The hot food provided was NOT hot. Sausages, eggs, and potatoes were all cold. The lids were never closed. There was a choice of cereal, fruit, yoghurt and toast and pastries and Asian food which was fine. We had breakfast included in the room rate but if had to pay extra would not recommend. Got there early first morning around 8 and very busy with tour groups and a bit chaotic. Second morning went around 9 and a lot quieter so would suggest that a better option. If the hotel could improve their breakfasts this hotel could be perfect. Having said that I would highly recommend anyone staying here for value and position. If travelling to Malaysia by bus the bus stop is just opposite the hotel one of the reasons we booked it."
"Good location and free water, but bad breakfast choices",Date of stay: December 2015,30,"We booked on this hotel because we find it accessible to any shopping center and cheap restaurant. I got no problem with this hotel except for the choices of food in their menus. Everyday they have same menu to the point we did not eat there at all. Great hotel facilities and most of all free water! oh by the way, internet connection is great!!"
Good location but ...,Date of stay: April 2016,30,Booked a twin room but on arrival told only a double room available. My friend and I were asked if we mind sharing a bed. Also told there was no wifi included. Friends we travelled with had their room upgraded and free wifi included. Need to take care when accessing the shower as the side of the bath is quite high - slipped when stepping in and have a large bruise on the side of my knee!
"Very disappointing stay, Stupid breakfast Menu",Date of stay: March 2016,20,"To start with no exhaust in the washroom ,plus no lock system for washrooms. No room service , whatsoever . Breakfast menu very very limited ,they don't consider cooking anything but their stupid Singapore food😤(just guessing if that was Singapore food or what else ). But Indians Beware ... You will Have to live on eggs and bread and some fruits . And not to forget , these people don't have any English channels whatsoever not even news channels . Very disappointing stay ."
Absolute Chaos - Well Located,Date of stay: March 2016,40,I have stayed at many of the Chancellor hotels throughout Asia/Australia and they are always a simple and comfortable hotel. This was no exception. It is a new hotel and as such was very clean - I was upgraded to a Executive room which was nice but nothing special.  They need to do something about their systems though. The hotel was absolutely full - there were two coachloads arrived as I tried to check in. Then at breakfast the queue took 40 minutes to even reach the buffet and it was fairly ordinary with a lot of the food run out - and I thought I got there early at 7:15.  Internet reception was good.  This experience will not change me from my favourite hotel. I only stayed here because that is where my client booked me.
Disappointing,Date of stay: March 2016,30,"Stayed 2 nights from 3rd March. Friendly reception although command of English basic. Very little assistance with tourist information. Our room was comfortable but bathroom mouldy. Location a positive and some decent eating places amongst expensive shopping area. Breakfast the next day was a HUGE disappointment. Cramped dining room, the minimal amount of western food being offered was all taken and when I found someone to ask for more supplies, I was rudely waved away. Eventually chose toast. Breakfast was included in room charge, next morning as we were heading for airport at 0630, BAD LUCK, dining room opens at 0700"
Location location & location,Date of stay: March 2016,40,"Excellent location, friendly staff not a great restaurant manager with his attitude. Truly exists based on its location wifi and staff. Small rooms but functional. Great idea of hot and cold water inside the room for drinking. Five nights stay was comfortable except some smell is out when u enter the room and it subsides during the stay. Restaurants, malls, night clubs ,mrt enough around to move around without any help or taxi.  Early checkin on request is advantage for travellers from india."
Hotel is not so good but not so bad.,Date of stay: March 2016,30,"We have booked the hotel via Ensogo website and stayed from 5-8 March 2016. Hotel is not big than we think at first , but it's location is good which it near Orchard road. It is not far from MRT station. We impressed on front desk staff that help us on this trip, his name is Gabriel. Just wanna say thank you for his hospitality service mind. That's all !!"
It was a good choice,Date of stay: March 2016,40,we stayed in chancellor@orchard from 3rd March to 8th March. The main reason for choosing this hotel was its location... orchard road. other than that nothing is especial here. I dont like their breakfast menu And ohh... the grumpy stuffs!!!!
Misleading consumers by booking.com,Date of stay: June 2015,10,"I made a reservation back on 6th June 2015 from India through booking.com for a three nights stay at Hotel Chancellor@Orchard Singapore . I was extremely disappointed in my stay at the hotel , where I had gone for a family vocation. This was my first time visiting this hotel, on arrival the front desk people were extremely rude . They have very poor customer service etiquettes. We had booked a four star hotel as said by booking.com but to my surprise it was no less than a two or three star hotel. The rooms were too small and the washroom door did not even had a lock with poor room service. We compliant to booking.com again and again but was of no help,unfortunetly my daughter fell ill . So there was not much we could do at that time . We felt cheated by booking.com as they gave wrong grading to the hotel which even the hotel staff agreed too. I would want everyone to be very careful before making any bookings throughbooking.com. CONSUMERS BEWARE !!!! This company is fraud. If no action is taken by booking.com than this review would be circulated to all travel potals and social networking sites before the holiday season starts in India."
Comfortable short stay,Date of stay: February 2016,40,"Overnighted in this hotel on my way to Sulawesi for business. Was suitably impressed by the recent rebuild that includes updated decor. My room was clean and the friendliness of the desk staff needs a mention.  The hotel appears to be one used predominantly by regional tourists (especially small tourist groups) and the occasional business person. The lobby area is relatively small with comfortable, but basic seating. My room wasn't ready when I arrived (landed at 0625). Unfortunately, there is no business centre, so I wasn't able to fill the time between arrival and occupying my room somewhere more appropriate. There is a rooftop pool that looked inviting, but didn't use. There is a guest laundry.  My room was clean with a modern angular edge to the design. The bed was very comfortable - an important feature of an acceptable hotel in my books. The bathroom was small, but clean and adequate. My room was very quiet. A feature is the hot/cold water dispenser - the water is filtered and safe to drink and via a tap of a button you room temperature or cold water for drinking, to hot water for the tea and coffee provided. Better than messy electric kettles and the sometimes challenging contortions needed to fill these from the bathroom sink.  The location is a street back from Orchard Road with its restaurants, eating areas and shopping centres.  All in all I would recommend this for short stays where you don't want to spend up big on accommodation."
OK but nothing special...,Date of stay: January 2016,30,"We stayed at this hotel for one night prior to commencing a cruise. Whilst it suited our purpose, it was nothing to write home about.  The hotel is ideally located close to Orchard road so is well suited for those looking to shop. The rooftop pool area was well kept and appeared very inviting, but we didn't really get the time to use it. This is where the positives end....  We arrived by airport shuttle bus and were ""greeted"" (no welcoming committee here) by a very uninspiring foyer and check-in area. After carrying our own bags upstairs to our room, we arrived at our very small room. It was ""ok"", but the bathroom was tiny and not very functional. The shower was located inside a very small bathtub with very high sides, which required great care to get in and out of. My wife had great difficulty exiting the shower and had a large bruise as result of knocking her leg on the way out.  The other big disappointment was the breakfast.... A self service buffet with very limited choices, especially for western tastes. Not even scrabbled eggs which is a staple of just about every hotel I have ever been in worldwide.  Sorry, but this hotel was not for me...."
Good location - but....,Date of stay: February 2016,30,"Stayed 17 February 2016 The room 960 was excellent but we got very little sleep due to the niteclub close-by. Music stopped at 5.30am! It appears from reviews that other people have had the same issue. If we ever stay here again, I would make sure that the room is a quiet room. We had problems with the door access card as did many other guest staying at that time. Often the queue at the help desk to get it re-activated was long.  We did appreciate the early check in and late checkout availability."
LOCATION LOCATION,Date of stay: January 2016,40,This hotel is off Orchard Road so location is excellent. Rooms are clean and well-kept. It's new so it was great. We were a group of 29 and stayed here after a cruise and we enjoyed it. They had a tourist help desk that was very helpful in arranging our tours and transfers. We just were not happy with the dining staff. Very unfriendly. We were travelling with a toddler who we did not want to wake up for breakfast so we thought of getting some croissant from the breakfast buffet to bring to the room. The manager stopped us and said we weren't allowed to do that. So we explained it was for the toddler but he still refused. He said we either eat the croissant or leave it in the dining area. i found it unbelievable that they would rather throw the food than bend the rule a bit. We're talking about a couple of croissants! For. A. Child. I thought that was very unreasonable.
Worst hotel ever!,Date of stay: February 2016,10,"Stayed in room 1056 and is the worst nightmare I ever had. There is a night club which operate from 12am to 6am, loud and noisy. The room is not sound proof at all. The next day I spoke to the hotel staff and he said: yes that room is noisy at night, why don't you ask to change room. It was mid night and I have breakfast meeting the next day so I was reluctant to call to complaint. But was so disappointed with his answers. The hotel staff should have trained better and apologize instead of reply disrespectful. Location was not the best, not every taxi driver knew this place because of the street. However still walking distance to orchard. Somerset mRT is inside shopping centre and the hotel is not on the main road but some back lane. Not advisable to carry luggage and walk all the way from somerset, have to cross 1 or 2 junctions. Amenities In the room was ok but the dispenser was rather difficult to use. Bath tub is slippery when shower. Breakfast is limited, pack at the main room but they open another dining hall which was ok. Not easy to call a cab so make sure u go to lobby earlier to request. Overall I won't stay here the next time I travel , overprice for its service, probably some 2 stars hotel better than this."
Stayed a night loved it,Date of stay: February 2016,50,"Stayed a night as a stopover, room was fantastic. Lovely staff who allowed us to,use the pool after we had checked out . We would really recommend this hotel. Great location .we caught the train from the airport and just walked rest of way ."
Great location.,Date of stay: February 2016,40,"Good value for money. Great location- next to Orchard Road, food courts. The rooms are clean and well appointed. When I first stayed here in August 2015, encountered problems with the Wifi which have been addressed. The staff ( Lisa, and Avenisha in particular) went out of their way to make sure that my stay was cimfortable. If you are looking for a clean, comfortable and well located hotel in Singapore to rest your head while you are out all day- this is it. I will stay here again."
Value for excellent location.,Date of stay: December 2015,40,"Great location just steps from the famous Orchard Road. Right next to Orchard Plaza and 2 blocks from The Centrepoint mall which is open from 10am to 10pm house many restaurants including Michelin awarded Din Tai Fung, shops and an Imax theatre. Very convenient. We were here at Christmas time and Orchard Road during the nightime was awash with colourful fairy lights with buildings glittering in festival icons and more lights. The illumination along the street was not gaudy or garish. Hats off to the designers and planners for such a class act. The hotel room was clean and inviting and our room overlooked the greenery of the nearby park which was a surprising and lovely sight even though we were in the heart of the shopping district. We did not have high expectations but were pleasantly surprised by the cosy and very clean room. It had an automatic hot and cold water dispenser (coffee and tea available) but we could not work the hot water button so had to do without our morning coffee. We arrived late and left very early in the morning so did not explore any of the hotel's facilities. We will definitely stay again - it is a small hotel nothing fancy but for its location, price paid and cleanliness, it makes for very good value."
1month stay - 4/5 overall,Date of stay: January 2016,40,"We stayed here before from Nov-Dec2015. Then we went back, and stayed here again. Here are my overall comments: 1. Room: (4/5) good enough. There's a refrigerator, and a water dispenser. 2. Housekeeping: (3/5) sometimes they replace mugs, sometimes not. 3. Buffet Breakfast: (3/5) there's not much variety. Just imagine me taking almost the same meal every morning. Lastly, when it's the manager who is in the entrance, it wont feel that its a good morning - he's usually frowning. It's better when the indian lady who watches over the entrance door. 4. Laundry Area: (4/5) there are 2 washers, and 2 dryers. I would have given it a 5 if only its not near the smoking area. 5. Staff: (5/5) everyone seems nice, except the manager at the restaurant area. I saw him once arguing with a customer."
Overnight stay before our cruise,Date of stay: November 2015,20,"The location is excellent - a short stroll to Orchard Road. Overall it is a basic comfortable hotel, the foyer needs much better quality seating - it has the look of a cheap Asian hotel.. When we checked in the room was occupied and we had to be allocated another .This is not good when guests arrive late evening on an international flight. The room had been upgraded but not to a high standard. However it was not the best location as it overlooked the noisy freeway.The electric water dispenser on the wall opposite our bed is like something you may see in a backpackers hotel. The new sheer curtains were hung without been pressed so they looked shabby - not shabby chic.The bed was comfortable, pillows not and there was a lack of bathroom amenities,and no tea/coffee milk.. I can see though that with extra care and attention to cleanliness and better facilities it will be a very good 3 star hotel.The staff are polite and friendly."
services for frontline hotel staff,Date of stay: January 2016,50,"Excellent service by the front office team & bellman service. Front office mgr mr benny an experience manager to handle the team , with on duty mgr ms lizah n mr alvin with good n polite response to serve the guest despite on heavy check in. Bellman team, mr irwan n team also very helpful to attend to the group that checking in n also very experience to handle the guest in courteous manner n vigilant in providing the necessary service...overall fully sastifaction with the frontline team n also the rooms are well maintain with wifi service for my business use,,,"
EXCELLENT STAY,Date of stay: December 2015,50,"stayed with my family of 3 and we were happy with everything.As a hotel worker couldnt find anything wrong. Love that Roof pool and breakfast was excellent too. will be back definitely, good rate, helpful staff and perfect location."
Proud to stay ....,Date of stay: December 2015,50,"Absolutely beautiful hotel which is located in central part of singapore. Extremely kind and efficient staffs, impeccable clean bathroom, amazing experience with 10th floor swimming pool, great exposure to singapore sceneries while swimming. Food is delicious, and enough spacious room. Overall, genuine 5 star facilities."
Great stay,Date of stay: January 2016,40,"After travelling for a month this final hotel was a good resting place. We arrived at 7.30 am after a 13 hkur flight and were able to check in early (thank god!). Beds were good qiality, shower was phenomenal, great rooms and bathroom. Great location close to Orchard rd and train station. Only downs:breakfast was ordinary, no pool towels provided."
recommented,Date of stay: January 2016,40,A very nice a familiar Hotel in best position in City with a friendly ands caring service. Roomservice friendly and highly flexible. Food is ok and inhouse restaurant supply nice dinner. Shop also avialiable for late snacks and beverages. I will return :-)
Convenient,Date of stay: January 2016,50,"Had check into this hotel for a few nights, in this most conveniently located hotel in the heart of orchard road. For excellent and economical shopping and food, a short walk to the MRT station. Breakfast was extensive if not outstanding and staff are having service excellent."
Great Stay,Date of stay: January 2016,40,What a great welcome by hotel staff....thank you Mr Benny Wong and Alvin who were so professional and could not do enough for you. The hi-lite of the stay is the welcome procedure and this was 100%. The staff were very obliging and very pleasant. The hotel was at the most perfect location if you want to shop/wine/dine. Very convenient and in the middle fo two MRT stations - Dhobi Ghaut and Somerset. The only thing I would change is the menu for breakfast....nothing special at all and the staff at the breakfast restaurant found it hard to smile..esp that Indian lady. As definate return to this hotel...hopefully the welcoming staff will not change. :-)
Clean Hotel but little bit noisy,Date of stay: December 2015,30,"The hotel is not far from Somerset MRT Sta. It nicer when access with bus. The room is clean but the sound insulation is not good. You will heard the sound of drums from the pub next to hotel until 2-3am in the morning. The quality of bed is average, and feel not too comfortable."
Location is good enough,Date of stay: January 2016,30,"Room is clean enough, taxi not recognise hotel, location not recognise, breakfast not various, no hospitalisation room, pure water provided in complicated dispeser not simple, lobby room not comfort chair too small"
Worst Hotel to imagine,Date of stay: January 2016,10,The rooms are adjacent to night club and the Loud sound will disturb you till morning and the Duty manager says rooms are Sound Proof? Horrible smell in toilets. This hotel is not more than a 2 star hotel. Worst hotel have stayed.
Overall a Good Stay,Date of stay: December 2015,40,"The hotel’s look and feel is fine, overall it was a fine experience. But there are definitely some areas of improvement which they must consider:  1. They have only one café where they organize nice buffet breakfast. After that they close half portion of it and convert it into Bistro which is not even functioning properly. Once we went there for dinner as we were tired but they didn’t show any interest in taking order and serving food. Rather they told us you can place your order with very limited choice of food options and then wait for 30-45 minutes for the food to come. They also advised us to go to a nearby food court . 2. No Gym, spa etc. which is certainly not expected from a 4* property. 3. No room service at all, we wanted milk for our younger one who is 2.5 years and they told we have to come to the cafe and take it to the room on our own. 4. The toiletries are below expectations. No separate hair shampoo – they give one gel for washing body and hair both. No shaving kit, no moisturizer etc. in short, they provide only towels, soap, dental kit and shower cap which is not expected from a 4* star property if it is a 4*in true sense."
Good for an overnight stopover.,Date of stay: December 2015,30,"This fairly newly reconstructed hotel has an impressive location just off Orchard Road, but falls short on the other requirements that most travellers require. Rooms are quite small, basically cleaned, and sparse on amenities. The location is its biggest asset, and for this reason, is good for a one or two night stopover, if you don't intend spending a lot of time in the room. We didn't try the breakfast, but there is a very impressive pool if wanting to cool down after a days touring or shopping. Would I stay again? Yes for an overnight stopover, but not for a long extended stay."
Average Stay,Date of stay: December 2015,20,"My son and I had a stopover in Singapore. This hotel was conveniently situated next to Orchard Road and we viewed the gorgeous Christmas lights. However, the twin room was very small with minimal toiletry supplies which made things difficult on our stopover. For the price I expected more for our money. We wanted to go to the Gardens by the Bay and we had to go to the hotel next door to get tourist assistance to organise this. Lastly, there was a soiled towel expected for our use: overall a disappointing night's stay."
Good for short visit,Date of stay: December 2015,40,Stayed for 1 night only and considered very good location behind all the busy malls at Orchard road. All can be reached by walking distance.  It is quite small but if you are like us only need a place to sleep for a few hours and good hot shower without bothering the breakfast. This is it. This place is for you.
Great service and nice stuff,Date of stay: December 2015,40,I have had a very convenient stay at this hotel. Stuff was very nice and great rooftop pool to start the day by a refreshing swim. Next time I will be back in the same place with our partners. Only the breakfast could improve a little for international hotel.
Good value for money,Date of stay: December 2015,40,A good value for money hotel in the heart of Singapore city. Rooms are clean eventhough they are a little on the small side. Reasonable breakfast. Hotel staff were attentive and flexible in regards to a late checkout. Would higly recommend this hotel for a stopover.
Over rated,Date of stay: November 2015,20,"It probably is the town that is expensive, but for the price we paid we would expected something better. The hotel is cold, no nice feeling when u get in. The room was small and the breakfast poor and crowded. On top of it, the second day we went back early afternoon to leave some stuff in the room and it had not been cleaned. We told the receptionist, who with surprise asked us really?? More than hundred euro a night....."
Great Location and Friendly Staff,Date of stay: November 2015,40,"One of the hotel staff Avinisha shes very friendly and respectful, as well as accommodating and helpful with her kindness. The location of this hotel between Sommerset and Dhoby Ghaut MRT stations is ideal for shopping and business. Very close to the best shopping malls & the many food places. Great swimming pool."
Great location,Date of stay: October 2015,40,"Located just a short distance to Orchard Rd, where all the shops are , Just around the corner , surrounded by bunch of open air wonderful restaurants.. stuff are very friendly , specially the manager Mr Denny , went all the way to walked us to the restaurant since we arrived evening so looking fo food to eat .. Only breakfast buffet not too impressive and not too organized , but it was a good deal for hotel so close to Orchard Rd..."
Great stay in the heart of orchard road,Date of stay: November 2015,50,I recently book a room for my business trip and when I step into the hotel I was very impressed with the reception staff who serve me in a very professional way n explained to me what I can do in orchard road and gotta my room keys despite being early for my check in.This is what I call AWESOME n FANTASTIC with no extra charges....CHEERS
Great service,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Just have a recent stay over the new property. To be honest I have read some negative review but I wish to experience by myself so I give it a go. Location is nice and price is reasonable. Able to tell why other guest experience some negative impact as the front desk is short handed yet they give it to their best anticipate guest request with heavy influx of arrival and departure guest. Every of my request is being met with satisfaction. Can see the staff are hardworking and the front office manager work from day till night holding his team together. Rooms are cosy and clean. Location is at the heart of shopping paradise. Will visit the property again when i'm in Singapore
One NIght Stay OK,Date of stay: October 2015,30,"Stayed for 1 night, room was small but the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was tiny and it was hard not to wet the whole floor. I don't think I would stay more than 1 night here, it is in the red light district, we arrived in the early hours of the morning, so things were in full swing. there was tea making facilities in the room but the only downside was that it was impossible to work out how to work the hot water machine, a simple kettle would be so much better. The breakfast was ok, for some reason they segregated us from the asian guests, the food would have been ok if there had of been more people to eat it and then it could of been refreshed more often. On a plus side it is close to Somerset stn, so if you are going to Marina Bay to catch a ship it is ideal location to get there."
Small but Clean,Date of stay: October 2015,40,"To be fair we didn't arrive until 4am due to plane running late, but I don't think we would spend anymore than 1 night here, the hotel is in the red light district so,even at 4am it was an eye opener. The room is small but the bed was comfortable and clean, the bathroom was tiny and the water went all over the floor. Breakfast was included, we found it quiet funny that they segregated us from the Asian customers. The food in our room was quiet substandard, mainly because there was not enough people so food just sat for ages. My husband made the decision to go into the other room and get food, it was more edible and interesting."
Bad Experience,Date of stay: October 2015,10,Poor Customer Service. Never say sorry & never wear a smile. I asked for a visiting card at the reception. The receptionist said it's not free & I can check the address & contact number on the envelope. Breakfast is poor. The only main thing is your staffs need to wear a big smile.
dissapointing end of holiday,Date of stay: October 2015,30,"such a let down at the end of a great holiday. I had hoped we could lay by the pool relaxing with a cocktail, after a leisurely breakfast. So much dissapointment with this hotel booking. The rooms had twin beds when asked if we could change, was told no other available. Asked for bed to be made up as a king so they just pushed two single beds together! Breakfast ""buffet"" was the worst I have ever eaten in a hotel. Cold boiled eggs only option, barely any fruit, no cold milk for cereal, no bacon, white bread only, 2 pastries left, cold coffee. Pool nice but no atmosphere, no cafe, no bar, no drinks, or snacks, no towels, no toilet paper in bathroom. Never again."
Poor experience,Date of stay: October 2015,10,"Tiny room, worst ever reception service - simply embarrassing bunch of incompetent and careless team, air conditioning more like a fan, minimal amenities and outrageous price for what u get. Never ever again."
Utterly disgusted,Date of stay: October 2015,10,Recently my travel company booked me accomadation here it had already been paid for while overseas the ATM ate my bank card so I had no money left but I only had that night to go so it was ok . But when I arrived no one was there to pick me up so I was not happy but found my way there with money I had left. When I was checking in it was all ok and he got me to sign the credit card payment from the company until I asked bout not picking me up and asked if they were dropping me of because I had no money the duty manager there joe kok then started to get rude and became very belligerent he then said oh wait there's a problem you haven't paid you need to pay or you can't stay mind you this is after I'd already seen the paid credit card receipt and told him I have no card or money . This went back and forth for ages and I did get annoyed when it became apparent that he wasn't going to budge and that he has a god like complex I had to walk then catch the bus back to airport where I spent the night on the chair. Now after what happened with my card then the hotel and the attitude of the duty manager JOE KOK and having to stay at the airport after having spinal surgery you can imagine I am not at all impressed with the way I was treated and don't want it happening to someone else. I will NEVER stay there NOR recommend anyone to you should not be able to treat people like garbage and get away with it.😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Avoid this hotel,Date of stay: October 2015,10,"This hotel is by no means a 4 star or 3 star hotel. Upon arrival at 11.30 pm nobody to bring bags up to our room, corridor is like a dormitory and no bar facilities either in room or in hotel for us to wind down. The room allowed us to hear the highway traffic whizzing past all night and the doof doof of the local night bar. Breakfast was a joke in itself. We were told to go to the corporate business break fast room - what a joke. The tables hadn't been cleared or cleaned in the 45 mins we were there, Manuel wasn't replenishing plates or food at a great rate and breakfast consisted of cereal hard boiled eggs ham floating in water - need I say more! There were 9 tables left uncleared and dirty and thus just isn't good enough"
Be aware before you go,Date of stay: October 2015,30,"Don't expect too much before you go and you will not be to disapointed . The room we had was perfectly clean which was a bonus. Unfortunately the room is very small with tiny bed and a bathroom which is more like a broom closet. TV would not work properly and had to get it reset a few times. I feel they could have been a bit more thoughtful when designing the room to make your stay a bit more comfortable. As everyone else have been saying the breakfast is not the best. Considering you don't get breakfast at all at a lot of the other hotels I was happy to be able to get a hot cup of tea , cereal and toast to start my day. The pool is large and very clean on a roof top. Great deck chairs to lounge around on. No pool towels so bring your own or use bath towels which was very annoying. The hotel is in a great location so this is a bonus. Not sure I would stay at this hotel again though."
"Low end Hotel, don't have high expectations for the price you paid",Date of stay: October 2015,10,"Front desk doesn't seems to know their job. Double charged me and had to do reversal. My booking was for a single large double bed but he told me I'm book for two single bed, and I had to produce my booking slip to prove my request. Went to my room and was in a total mess (1800H). Called the reception and told them the room was a mess and instead of changing the room for me, told me to wait for house keeping to come and clean. Waited 10 mins and the guy showed up, looked shocked at the state of the room, called the front desk, and then told me to go to the front desk to have my room changed. POOR Service and awareness! The breakfast is really low end with not much choices. I end up having 2 hard boiled eggs (that's the only choice for eggs)."
"Compact rooms... all in all poor facilities - dinning, service etc",Date of stay: October 2015,10,Look for better option I am sure you can get better place at this price. In short not a value for money place. Complimentary breakfast is terrible without any options. Staff is generous but most of them especially restaurant are lost .. fairly new just out of school. Impossible to find any Managers around
New Hotel but Average Service,Date of stay: September 2015,30,"Stayed during my business trip in September 2015 and overall was average. Rooms okay but service was poor as staff are not friendly, Breakfast was bad and not much choices, like in a school cafeteria. Location is good."
"great location, bad shower",Date of stay: October 2015,30,"My wife and I have stayed in many places whenever we visit Singapore and this is the first time we used this hotel. The location cannot be beat, 3 mins walk to the nearest shopping centre for the wife and about 5-10 mins walk to the nearest MRT station. Fantastic location.  Check in was quick, while they did not seem to have the room ready at 12, the lobby manager was able to get us into a room very quick.  Perhaps it is too new, or the fact that it is an old building. The water pressure is very weak. The water temperature also fluctuate greatly from icy cold to scalding hot. Spoke to the reception about this, and the maintenance guy came and basically said every single room is the same. Try taking shower when no one else is taking a shower is his recommendation, which will involve some Professor X type powers or my recommendation, Just take a bath.  Cannot be beat location. Crap Shower."
Excellent location and Stay,Date of stay: September 2015,40,"The hotel is located in Orchard and yeah thats the main attraction. You are located in the most happening place in Singapore. Though the room size is small its been well maintained. Staffs are friendly and is very helping. The only problems I faced, was the small restaurant which makes our breakfast delayed a while as the hotel was fully occupied and vice versa the restaurant was full. Wifi consumption is also restricted to 50 mb usage per room. Overall nice experience. Strongly reccommended"
"Excellent location, normal mid-budget hotel",Date of stay: September 2015,40,"Even though I read the many negative reviews here, I chose to stay anyway for 3 nights, and I was pretty happy. Why did I take the chance? Well, knowing that most Sing hotels are small-bordering-cramped with bare amenities and terrible breakfasts (this one is no exception), I totally understand that a person with Caucasian build would suffer. The bed was almost too short for my 5ft4 /160 cm hubby, the shower box had no closure (and also very small, needless to say), no full-length mirror for those concerned about looking sharp before heading out, and half the floor space was taken up by my one gigantic suitcase for me, hubby and 3 yr old. On weekend nights the blare of some party house can be felt, although quiet enough to sleep. I was on the 7th floor. On the other hand, being short and small I had no problem with space. I appreciate the automated water dispenser: hot, room temp, cold, especially for making milk bottles in the middle of the night. The window reveals a fresh dense cluster of treetops, lessening the cramp. And I don't even bother going to breakfast, even though it was included. I buy my favorite fruits, snacks and charcuterie from the 24hr Cold Storage from a block away and keep them in the provided mini fridge, and I have the best breakfast ever. And on this trip, I never even used the MRT/bus because basically Orchard has everything (to buy) within walking distance. This hotel is located behind Concorde Hotel, not exactly a new building, but it's recently opened and nice enough. I was just slightly upset because they tried to give me a twin room instead of a double bed despite having booked 3 weeks in advance. But in the end I had a double. I was with a toddler for God's sake... so overall, until I feel I can spend an extra Sing $100 and stay at Mandarin Orchard, I'll opt for this one :)"
Overnight,Date of stay: September 2015,40,"This was just an overnight on our way to the cruise terminal. We were extremely impressed with the hotel , the price and the location. The included breakfast was a bit sparse but adequate. We would recommend this hotel for short stays. The Staff were not as responsive on leaving as there were on arriving."
2 star property,Date of stay: September 2015,20,"On another web site this claims to be a 4 star property. I have stayed at many hotels around the world and I can say without equivocation that this is a 2 star property. I was amazed to find that the bedroom had no drawers at all for clothes. In addition there was only one hangar in the wardrobe. The breakfast was very basic.  There were about 5 TV channels only one of which was in English. There were no newspapers, no toilet brush and it was a challenge to keep the shower water from going all over the bathroom.  This property is designed to attract lower level Asian tour groups and should be avoided by European travelers at all costs."
Low Cost Convenience at Orchard Rd,Date of stay: September 2015,40,"Staying here for 5 days and find this hotel very conveniently located and at a decent price of around SGD 200. Sommerset MRT within 10 mins walk, plenty of simple and mid range food nearby. Breakfast in the hotel is very simple, TV has only few channels. But to watch football live, there are nearby shops to provide this :)"
Give this one a miss,Date of stay: September 2015,20,Stayed here for three nights whilst returning from the UK. Our first impression was not a good one. The chap that dealt with us at reception never smiled once. There was no warmth at all The room was OK but nothing special. bedside table missing on one side of bed. No drawers in wardrobe for laying clothes away. The ultimate disappointment was the breakfast in the mornings it was just basically a cafeteria experience queued up for everything. Most items were running out and looked a mess in the baymaries the hot food was cold. All in all it was abysmal. Most disappointing especially as we had stayed in a fantastic hotel going to the UK and couldn't help keep comparing (that hotel was Adonis) end of the day my biggest mistake was not checking reviews before booking this hotel (it was too new for any reviews to be written) if that happens again I won't risk it. I will definitely only book a hotel that's got good reviews on here
Noisy nightclub nearby,Date of stay: September 2015,20,"Good location, except one end of the hotel is next to a night club. We could hear the music and felt the base reverberating on the 8th floor.  For the inconvenience of this noise issue, that they are apparently aware of, they wanted to charge an extra $20 per night to move to an upgraded double room at 3am. We were given a twin room so that we could get some sleep and rearranged it into a double ourselves. It would have been good to know when we had checked in so we could have sorted it out then. We were told that no double rooms available at check in, but it was not a surprise that we were arriving as we had booked well in advance. It seems you get a different level of service when booking a special room rate. They managed to find us a double room but clearly not the best.  Not a good way to help with jetlag. Otherwise good location and tidy hotel, close to the shopping, The staff are friendly but not the best at resolving these type of issues.  Not worth the hassle for a short stop over, jet lag recovery type of stay.  Plenty of other options around."
Management needs to be upgraded,Date of stay: August 2015,30,"Good new hotel but a number of things need sorting out. Staff were very good but need training from management. Cleaning in corridors and rooms not up to scratch. Rubbish on floor by lift took 3 days to clean. Free breakfast rather small did get better a couple of days. Only one guy running this breakfast, very hard work for him. Paid breakfast long ques. Reception packed most of the time because catering for package tour industry. I am sure it will get better if the management get their act together."
"Great location, average hotel",Date of stay: August 2015,30,"The hotel's location at the beginning of Orchard Street is its highlight. A decent hotel with a reasonable price. Ideal for city travel and shopping. The staff were courteous and helpful. Rooms are small, but with the price they sell, you cannot complain. The general cleanliness of the room needs a lot of improvement. Carpets were stained and the toilet was stinking, even though the hotel is just a few months old."
Just Average,Date of stay: August 2015,20,"Just an average hotel. Rooms are quite small. I was okay traveling as a single, but I think with a couple in the room it would be rather cramped. Bed is small, I an just over 6"" (172cm) and my feet hung over the end of the bed. Bathroom was okay, although no hanging points for used towels. Also whenever someone on the floor flushed their toilet the it took all the cold water from the shower. Fridge in the room is a joke, wouldn't fit a 1.25 lt bottle of Coke until I removed some of the shelves. Eco Friendly Water dispenser is also a joke, would only dispense two glasses of chilled water before it needed time to chill more water. As other reviewers have mentioned, don't worry about the breakfast, a total shambles! I'm sure there are better hotels at an equivalent price in Singapore. Location is okay, just off Orchid Road and within walking distance of two MRT stations"
The Boolaroo Bunch,Date of stay: August 2015,10,Please don't waste your money on this location. It is situated just off Orchard Road but the service is terrible...staff very hard to understand. Beds are like sleeping on concrete with pillows to match. The Eco friendly coffee machine is a nightmare to understand. We were on the 9th floor facing NE and after a long 12 flight from Paris a very loud band kept us awake till 4a.m. The place was full of asian children doing tours and cram as many as they could into elevators. The only good thing about this hotel is the shower. The hop on/off bus was excellent and stopped just out front on Orchard Plaza and shopping is plentiful. This hotel is not for people who want the comforts of a 4 star...this is FAR from it!
Awesome Gem Hotel And Friendly Front Desk Staff,Date of stay: August 2015,50,"Awesome hotel with new rooms,comfy bed,stylish room decor,free wifi n my check in was awesome with beautiful ladies from the front desk who were very professional n cheerful. kudos to Anishah,Lizah,Jennifer n Ayu...you gals are simply awesome,amazing n fantastic"
neither bad nor good,Date of stay: July 2015,30,"stay for 1night, my travel agent suggest this hotel, because it just opened recently. The location of the hotel is good, the room is clean but quite small, the bathroom also, the internet service is limited, you must pay if you want to use more than the quota they give."
"Some good, some bad",Date of stay: August 2015,30,"Good: roof pool and overall cleanliness.  Bad: breakfast, lots of sweet stuff but no scrambled eggs or bacon for more Western tastes. Chaotic.  Internet access (watch out they will bill you after ""free 50MB""!!! without warning ). Better to get a 3G sim at airport which you can use outside hotel too."
Good and not so...,Date of stay: August 2015,30,"I stayed at the Chancellor@ Orchard on my way though Singapore, on a Singapore stopover. I chose it because I had very little time in the city, and needed to be within easy walking distance of food and shopping.  First, the good. The position is really convenient, being within a short spit (don't, it's illegal in Singapore!) of the huge mall fest that is Orchard St. Bars, restaurants, ten story malls - all just around the corner. The hotel has clearly been refurbished recently, and the room I had looked great. Although some travellers have found it noisy, I didn't. My room was clean, and functional. Ish. There was free wifi, which largely worked. The bed was just fine.  The not so good. Well, my sink had a minor issue with directing water down into the waste water system, that is to say, it didn't. It directed water all over the bathroom floor, which was less convenient. A call to the desk bought a couple of very obliging and utterly useless handy type persons who performed a decent impression of the Keystone Cops in the bathroom, but with added water. It was most entertaining - and who can complain about free in room entertainment? I was imessaging my partner with updates as various clunks and spurting sounds issued thence, which was also fun - but I was really hungry and actually wanted to go out. Of course it was not fixed, and I was told that it would be done tomorrow by an actual plumber. Helpful when you are on a one night stay. The room was fitted with a kind of water filter that also, completely hypothetically, gives you hot water to make tea with. I'm English. I need tea like I need air. It dribbled out vaguely tepid water onto my precious teabag (always travel with them) which had me weeping softly into my pillow. I didn't dare complain about this too, for fear of the keystone plumbers returning to my sanctuary, but put on my glad rags and headed to the bright lights of Singapore.  The hotel needs to add some of the little things that make a room actually useful to the short term traveller with only hand luggage. Charging stations, a bin in the bathroom, toiletries, a clock, some, ANY, info about the hotel or area, a sink that works ...  Its not a bad place to stay, the pluses are big ones and the minuses small, and merely irritating. So you'd be safe to give it a go.  As an aside, doing a Singapore stopover as a solo traveller is ludicrously expensive. You pay 50% more than you would for BOTH travellers to stay in a double room, and I think this is bonkers. This, though, is not the fault of the hotel."
DO NOT stay at this hotel unless you want a BUDGET ROOM,Date of stay: August 2015,10,"This was recommended to me by Singapore Airlines as a new hotel. It is on their catagory B stopover packages. It is the WORST hotel that I have ever stayed in. It is a budget Hotel. The beds cater for short people. My husband is 6ft tall and his legs were hanging over the bed. The room bar is empty, they dont supply drinks or snacks., We had trouble with our T.V. There is no bar area in the lobby to relax and meet other people. The breakfast is the worst I have ever had. Firstly you need to queue up outside the lift area, then outside and once your inside you need to give your room number and line up again to get your plate. The food is like a school camp meal, baked beans, fried chips, boiled mini frankfurts, boiled eggs in their shell sitting in water, noodles and toast. The two toasters were not working for 2 days so there was no toast. I complained to the manager twice and told him that at other hotels you would get omlettes and a wide variety of foods. His reply was that they cater for large Chinese coach tours, so they need to move people quickly. I was a travel agent for 10 years and have travelled to many countries over the last 37 year and I can honestly say this is the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in"
Disaster,Date of stay: July 2015,10,"Breakfast is a disgrace, no toast, empty trays, 30 mins of lining up then try and find a table. Empty bar fridge, beds too small. No towels at swimming pool, told to take my own. We were so disappointed as this was recommended by Singapore airlines and thought it being a new holiday would finish off our holiday."
Worst hotel in Singapore.,Date of stay: August 2015,10,"Wow. Where do I start!!!! Firstly the positives... Its in a convenient location.. The negatives.. By far the worst breakfast i have had at a hotel anywhere in the world.... we couldnt eat it it was terrible.... (thats assuming there was anything left in the pots... ) more than 3/4s were always empty and the 1/4 that wasnt was for good reason People just wouldnt touch it... and for normal Singapore quality...this is just unheard of!!! Its a relatively new hotel bit geezots not maintained very well.. very dirty bathrooms. We went to the rooftop pool but there were not towles provided so we went back downstairs to our room and used our room towels. Then called up to get some more towels only to be rudely abused on the phone asking us why do we need more towels and how many people are staying in our room!!!!!! To which we said its because we used our two up on the pool!!!! Still they weren't happy.  I can go on but dont want to sound too whingey... i woukd think twice before booking this hotel..  In short.. great location terribly, terribly ran!!!!"
Atrocious !,Date of stay: August 2015,10,"The worst hotel I've ever stayed in !  The hotel is listed as a 4* on many travel sites, but at best it can be considered as a budget hotel.  I had the misfortune of having to stay in this hotel for a week. The room ends before it begins. The TV doesn't work. The free WiFi is too miniscule to last a day (shared between 2 people). The bathroom is smaller than cupboards in other hotels. A soap dispenser is the do-all & end-all of toiletries. A hot/cold water dispenser is available to meet all your water/ tea/ coffee needs. They are miserly in providing tea/ coffee/ sugar/ creamer. If you end up with an odd-numbered room, you end facing a blank wall. ON the flip side, the road facing rooms have traffic noise as the rooms are not properly sound-proofed.  The less said about the Breakfast the better. The duty manager is a surly fellow, with never a smile on his face. One huge hall serves a very basic breakfast. Boiled eggs & sausage everyday. No live Eggs-Station, Baked beans/Horse Gram, Noodles (one day flat, next day round), No cheese, no cold-cuts, nothing for vegetarians besides Bread...And THREE days the toaster was out of order.  There's no Room service. The room keys get repeatedly de-magnetised, and I could see guests struggling in the lifts daily. I became the unofficial advisor to all the harried people...many of whom were not even fluent with English.  The only redeeming feature was the location. Although the hotel claims to be on Orchard Road, and lists its address as Cavenagh Road, the entry is from a side lane on Kramat Road. There is a food court next to Concorde Hotel which can provide good local food.  I can give the hotel the benefit of doubt, as they themselves say they are in a ""soft-launch"" phase. I had asked for a 4* hotel, paid 4* prices, and got this very basic service. I think my travel agents, MAKE MY TRIP, are more to blame."
It's okay.,Date of stay: July 2015,40,"Stayed for 2 nights and no complaint. The room was clean, no unwanted smell or something like that.  I like the giftshop in this hotel where I can buy bundle of things for cheap price.  But, I don't like the food in the morning here. It's all breads, butter breads, sausages (made by flour and spices... I think), mashed potato...rice congee with beans, seaweed.... Starch everywhere.  And, there is no white light in my room. All yellow, it's hard to look at my face in the mirror, or changing clothes.  You have to pay the fee of S$12/day for wifi."
Awful for the lack of better word,Date of stay: July 2015,10,We stayed for 3 nights and were 6 couples. ULTRA RUDE STAFF NO AMENITIES WHATSOEVER. Took 3 hours to check in 6 rooms. Staff very unhelpful. Location though is good if u wanna visit orchard road. Rooms minimalistic though clean. Please don't visit
"Poor service, avoid",Date of stay: July 2015,20,"Good location and room suitable but poor slow service from staff. Restricted menu with poor quality at inflated prices.slow, surly and arrogant service at reception. Disturbed towels suggest someone came in during my absence but if it was room service, it was totally inefficient with bed not made and toiletries haphazardly scattered around. Someone repeatedly rang the bell during my shower to apologise when I finally opened the door. Very weird. "" Free"" wifi did not work."
1 star hotel at 4 star prices,Date of stay: July 2015,10,We were charged $240 a night which at first seemed like a bargain as the rest near orchard rd were booked out or was at least $350 per night. When we got in the room it sinks in that this is a cheap tour hotel. The room was tiny and the bathroom was right next to the bed. The room was a mess and filled with cigarette smell (even though the hotel is supposed to be non smoking). We rang reception and no one picked up. We went down to reception and they said they would clean it up by evening. When we got back at 10pm the rubbish from previous stayers were still there. We had to clean up and put the rubbish in the bin. The worst thing about the hotel is there is a night club across the road which thinks it needs to turn up the music so the whole of Singapore can hear and it goes literally all night to 5am. The included breakfast was average at best. Definitely recommended to stay away from this hotel at any price. The only positives was the decor looks new and the TV is a smart TV.
Give it a miss,Date of stay: July 2015,10,"Very disappointed! Don't bother. Good location. Room was clean & adequate. No wifi available for the 2 days we stayed. Breakfast was atrocious....huge queue's, no food & rude staff. Book room only.....hawker market for descent breakfast"
Pleasant surprise,Date of stay: July 2015,50,"Stayed one night at this new hotel in Orchard Road and I would recommend it for a few reasons.  Location. The hotel is within walking distance to the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. The hotel is surrounded by eateries, bars, shops and is a short walk to the main shopping area. The room was basic but it was adequate for me, there's a hot & cold water dispenser that was convenient. Then there was the TV. There are only local TV channels available so that wasn't interesting. However, good surprise as I could get connected to the Internet via the TV and it's free! It's easy to use and I can access YouTube with just 1 click. I could even listen to my favourite radio station back home! No buffering, better than my mobile data! There were some family tour groups staying on my level so it could get rather noisy at night with lots of movement outside, but it didn't bother me that much."
New Hotel And Magic Man,Date of stay: June 2015,50,"Hotel is very new when i check out hotel still dont have trip advisor page. when i checked in some floors are still not open.location in the middle of orchard road.
