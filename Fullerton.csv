the best hoytel ever highly recommand,Date of stay: October 2022,50,"Make sure to go to Singapore, please must go The Fullerton Hotel! I strongly recommend it. I stayed here for two days to celebrate my mom's birthday. I was moved by the special experience and fantastic service. Especially Kate Joe is a very good hotelier! Thank you very much. She said it's the best hotel she's ever been to I'm so happy. It's an unforgettable trip."
Excellent service and staff saved me from misunderstanding this famous hotel (bez of my own stupid mistake),Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Simply fall in love immediately after entering this famous Fullerton Building at the center of the city! Every corner is full of history!!!  The staff are very nice and helpful! They first surprise us by arranging special decoration inside the room (I only mentioned to the hotel restaurant that my afternoon tea is for celebrating our anniversary but I didn’t tell the room reservation!) with two lovely bears holding the balloons (and we can take them HOME!!!!) There is complimentary update and the room is clean, capacious and comfy!  Thanks Kate, front desk staff, for helping me assisting me to finish an urgent document at work by printing the document hard copy for me and guide me for postage back to Hong Kong ! Excellent service.  I MUST thanks Albert in the Courtyard at the lobby of Fullerton. He saved me from misunderstanding the hotel!!!! I written to the restaurant 2 mths prior arrival to book their famous afternoon tea for anniversary celebration and I really had extremely high expectation bez I am fan of afternoon tea!!! I was so frustrated and furious when I start eating the tea as the taste was sooooooo horrible and unacceptable until I cannot tolerate … my hubby saw that we are having a different set from other people…. We were given a vegan set!!!!! Albert came to assist us and letting us know that according to their record, we have requested that ! We were sooooo puzzled and shocked!!! He really handled this very nicely and gave us a complete new afternoon tea set and new coffee/ tea to relieved our emotion ! Later, we searched back the email that at the very very beginning I told the reservation team that I am interested in their plant- based menu (which I don’t realised it is a completely vegan set when I looked at the menu two mths ago) ! I really highly appreciate Albert professional handling of guests and customers that he didn’t make me feel bad even eventfully I found out it is my mistake to cause misunderstanding. The way he served us make us feel not so embarrassed and saved our anniversary celebration! He told just we still have time to enjoy ourselves ^^ I feel so good for his hospitality!!!!!  Experienced staff like Albert with kind heart and hospitality is what an excellent hotel should treasure and value! Thanks a lot for saving our celebration and my impression to Fullerton (not to misunderstand bez if my own mistake)"
Excellent customer service and just a beautiful grand hotel!,Date of stay: September 2022,50,"The Fullerton is a Grand hotel. The building is stunning, and in a great location. The bay view rooms are extraordinary and the customer service is excellent. In particular, Chandra was on top of every detail and made sure not only that we felt special, but well looked after while my husband and I were out and about. Thanks Chandra and the whole team."
A hotel that must visit in Singapore,Date of stay: October 2022,50,"We visited the hotel during weekdays. Very elegant hotel. Clean and comfortable room. Breakfast service was good and we had a nice dinner in the hotel restaurant, Jade. Hotel staff are all friendly especially Shazwan from front desk has been very polite and helpful. Definitely will visit the hotel again and recommend to my friends."
Perfect hotel,Date of stay: October 2022,50,"Very nice hotel, nice view, perfect hospitality, awesome staff especially senior duty manager mr andrew yip very helpfull nice person, for those people who wanted to stay this hotel, please find mr andrew, he will give perfect hospitality, and willing to fulfill your needs.

Very nice place,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Everything was great at this hotel.. amazing staff that is friendly and makes customers feel welcome.The rooms were clean, very comfortable, They went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable. . amazing that is friendly and makes customers feel welcome. highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting singapore"
Dr,Date of stay: October 2022,50,Excellent service by Aaron and Hafiz at the Concierge desk.  Aaron was very persistent in ensuring our flying tickets are in good order. He took hours to clarify issues.  And Hafiz took care of our local trips to various places.  We highly commend both for unbeatable service.  Thank you.
Incredible building and service…,Date of stay: October 2022,50,"…which made staying here such a treat for our first night in Singapore! The conversion job done here from governmental buildings to luxury hotel is incredible and it still all looks fantastic. The swimming pool has a wonderful view to make up for the limited space and all the members of staff were really helpful and friendly, especially the door staff. Even the choice of art work in our room and on our corridor was perfect! I wish we had stayed longer…"
Wow wow wow!,Date of stay: October 2022,50,"Greetings from KL!, I received nothing but top notch service to summarize my 3 nights at this magnificent building! It was also the best time to stay there as it coincided with the F1!...Not only was the building and rooms in great state of condition, the staff at all levels, from the lobby to the rooms were immaculate. A few staff stood out above the rest mainly Zain at the concierge, Victor at the lobby and Jurianah at the front desk! All in all it was a memorable stay for all of us. You are now assured of a loyal hotel guests."
Amazing experience at Fullerton hotel,Date of stay: August 2022,50,the room is so nice and the view outside the window is beautiful.And me and my friends spend some times at the pool over looking the view in the city its relaxing moment.we went to buffet for dinner and they have alot of delicious food to choose from.
Memorable weekend for family,Date of stay: October 2022,50,"I had a wonderful experience at The Fullerton Hotel. Amazing location and my room is facing Marina Bay with a balcony. The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was very helpful. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting downtown."
Incredible F1 Weekend,Date of stay: October 2022,50,"We had a wonderful stay for F1 Weekend Newly renovated room with balcony overlooking Turn 13 and the whole of Marina Bay. Attentive staff, and excellent food. The pool deck has great views over Singapore river and downtown. Huge thanks to Terry and team for giving us an amazing weekend of memories."
Super Hotel with a few niggles,Date of stay: September 2022,50,"On early arrival on a very damp September morning with high expectations we were slightly deflated not to get an immediate early check in but this was tempered by the coffee and cake provided by a very kind staff member. We were allocated our room at 10.30 and had to pay a £660 pre authorisation that I felt was a little unreasonable . However that was the downside as the remainder of our stay was memorable. Our room was luxurious and had super views of the Quay and every item one wished for was to hand. The concierge even provided umbrellas. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the whole team worked extremely hard. This is an outstanding hotel and there were niggles such as being told there were no tables available in Jade but to return a couple of hours later (looking much smarter) and were immediately shown to our table. The dinner at Jade, though expensive, was superb and we enjoyed every mouthful. Niggles aside the comfort and quality were superb"
Nice but forgettable,Date of stay: September 2022,30,"It was a pleasant stay with our kids but nothing very memorable. The kids love the bed and bath tub, the tv channels and the breakfast spread like any other hotels. There isn't much activities for kids but this isn't a family friendly hotel to begin with. But our request for a small cake to celebrate their belated birthday wasn't attended to, even after asking about it twice. We learnt from friends that kids usually receive a mini Fullerton Bear during check-in and requested for 1 during check out but was turned down by being ignored by the concierge. It would have been a nice stay for couples but not for family. Probably won't come again."
Beautiful hotel in a great location.,Date of stay: August 2022,40,"This was our second stay at the Fullerton Hotel. We love the old world charm of the hotel as well as the location being close to the river with lots of restaurants and raffles MRT station. All of the staff are extremely friendly and helpful making you feel right at home. A special mention must go to Sall around the pool. He always greets you with a smile and ice cold water and loves to have a chat with the guests. He is a real credit to the hotel. We stayed in a heritage room overlooking the marina. It was kept clean with plenty of towels. Maybe they could replenish the soaps etc a bit more regularly. We ate breakfast in the Town restaurant every morning and although the variety was fantastic the western style food was always cold, except for the freshly made eggs! It didn’t matter if you were there at the start of service or a couple of hours in. This is a major issue that needs to be rectified. We also ate at the seafood buffet one night and it was the same. Quite disappointing for the price you have to pay. The pool area is spectacular and a great way to spend a few hours after sightseeing. Can’t wait to return on our next visit to Singapore!"
Great 3 nights stay - Straits Club,Date of stay: September 2022,50,"Had an excellent stay in at the Fullerton for 3 nights in September, we enjoyed Straits club breakfast afternoon tea and evening cocktails and canapés! Crystal and Ryan were wonderful and very attentive throughout our stay - we can’t wait to come back with family at Easter time next year!"
Location and rooms are superior,Date of stay: September 2022,40,"We stayed twice in week in two seperate bookings. Our rooms where renovated and had views out over the bay. Room service was amazing and suited our palates after both flights where delayed.  Our third night was a disaster, due to the airline cancelling our flight. The issue being we had to take the last room that seemed to be available, it was hot and unrenovated on level 4. Sadly the hotel was fully booked due to the Grand Prix lead up. The room was oversized and a window which if you stood on a chair it has a view. We just couldn’t resist to take a photo as my husband is ‘6.4’.  Overall we liked our stay but the last night stay was substandard for the price tag.  The stand out team member was Chandra at the door who helped with our room swap and front door."
Staff,Date of stay: September 2022,50,Chandra was very nice and his services were great. Excellent at his job. He offered to call taxis every time be saw us in the lobby and all the other staff had great recommendations as well. Cleaning services are excellent no need to worry.
Fantastic Hotel!!,Date of stay: September 2022,50,"Amazing hotel with amazing service! Checkin was flawless and the room was well appointed. No refreshing needed in the room as everything was neat, clean, and not showing any signs of wear and tear. Mini bar and snacks were great.  For breakfast, the cafe in the lobby was good. No complaints whatsoever ever. If you are looking for old world charm with newer amenities, this is the place to stay.  For guests, two things to consider, there isn’t a hotel “gift” shop so if you need meds, drinks, snacks, there is a 24 Hr 7-11 less than 10min walk. Also, I did have a terrible experience at the Spa, but not holding that against the hotel given it is separate. Be very careful when booking any service with the spa. Never again!"
Luxury overlooking the bay,Date of stay: September 2022,50,"We loved the service and room at this hotel which is conveniently located to the train. We had a small balcony that overlooked the bay. The room was quiet, well appointed, and very comfortable. The pool was small so we skipped using it. The Town restaurant had a good breakfast buffet."
Daughter's 22nd Birthday,Date of stay: September 2022,40,"My family staycation at the Palladian Suite is satisfactory. The staff are commendable and Strait Club privileges are excellent! We dined well at Town Restaurant & Courtyard ; Mr Kumar Duty Mgr at the latter went out of his way to wrap up our staycation with distinction by accommodating to our needs. The SPA was excellent too. An improvement to make is to ensure room amenities prepared for the number of registered adults upon check in. I wasted time requesting for the third of everything (slipper, bath robe & towel, tooth brush etc) for my family of 3 despite the same request made at reservation. I am open to visiting The Fullerton again!"
"Nice historic hotel. walking distance to tourist, business district and food area, expect nonhalal kitchen but can request halal",Date of stay: September 2022,50,"A well maintained historic hotel in the heart of Singapore.  We stayed here as a family of 4, driven all the way from Kuala Lumpur, the concierge were helpful and frontdesk made me felt that checkin is so effortless. When you arrived at the main entrance, a nice ambiance of serenity and friendliness greeted you. Among the few hotels I've stayed before with nice scent in the air.  The breakfast was scrumptious, although the kitchen was not Halal certified. We opted mostly on vegetarian and seafoods, which still have a good range of selection. Kids were thrilled to be given colouring kits and free scoop of ice cream. Price wise a bit pricey, but then again I think it was the standard price for its class.  The pool on the other hand was a bit small or nothing too fancy for kids to really want to dive in.  Rooms were well maintained, although the lifts are located on either end of the building. So if your room is right smack in the middle, expect a little bit more of a walk as compared to those near the lifts.  Location wise is the best, near to food outlets, historic locations, business district and tourist attractions."
"From Sabah, Malaysia",Date of stay: September 2022,50,"Superb facilities, comfortable room and strategic location. Concierge service specially Chandra was awesome from guide to check in counters, introduced all the function in the room to carrying the luggages and bags with smile and care plus looking out for the cab while I sit back and rest. Well done"
What a luxurious hotel!,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"What a luxurious hotel with historic features and classical beauty. This hotel will be the first and last classic moody hotel in this bustling city center. Esay to meet view of famous marinabay hotel at any angle within 5 min walk distance. The afternoon tea set was oppulent and accompanied by relaxing music .Great location, a walk away from trendy hotspots."
Top notch property,Date of stay: August 2022,50,This is a truly high end property. I would recommend this place over MB Sands any day. Feels exclusive and does not have the swarms of tourists that you find across the bay. Very pleased with the room size and staff service.
Amazing Hotel!,Date of stay: September 2022,50,"First time ever visiting Fullerton Hotel Singapore last week. was in awe, very beautiful and super clean rooms, very friendly staff, the breakfast buffet was out of this world! They even had a piece of birthday cake for me at my arrival of in my room..so thoughtful! I hope on my next visit to Singapore, i can stay there again, very recommendable!"
Great location and decor. Terrible service.,Date of stay: September 2022,30,"Came to The Fullerton Hotel Singapore for a business conference. The location is convenient and decor is immaculate. Would love visit this location again.  However, the service staff can be quite unhelpful, preferring to tell you ""I don't know"" instead of giving some assistance - I was trying to find a charging port for work and one of their wall ports was not working. I tried look around the lobby and instead of directing my to any functioning ports, preferred to tell me that I am not allow to sit at this or that location. Not sure if this is the kind of service I would like to bring my clients to. I think Pan Pacific would have been a better choice."
"If you want the best hotel in Singapore, this is it",Date of stay: September 2022,50,"We have stayed at The Fullerton a number of times previously. Never disappointed. It is truly a fabulous hotel in every aspect. This time we stayed 9 days. Our room was very clean and comfortable with great views out over Marina Bay. The bathroom was spotless, had lots of space and amenities. Our room was on the same floor as the Straits Club, so access was easy.  Nicholas, Siti and the Team at the Straits Club were as usual proactive, attentive and extremely helpful. Food and drinks were high quality and very tempting. Ryan, Chia Yi, Crystal and Zep provided exceptional service. They made our stay most enjoyable.  We took the Fullerton Heritage Tour this time. Bill the tour guide was very knowledgeable. The tour brought back wonderful memories for us, as we used to post letters here at the GPO when we lived in Singapore many years ago. The building has been tastefully renovated while still keeping many of the original GPO features.  The hotel is situated in a great location. An easy walk to the MRT, buses also at the front of the hotel and the river walks are pleasant.  Looking forward to visiting again early next year."
Wonderful staycation!,Date of stay: September 2022,50,"The holistic service provided by Fullerton hotel was nothing short of perfect. From the restaurant (Courtyard) to the in-room dining service, you could tell that their staff were trained very well as it’s reflected in the impeccable service provided to me during my short stay there.  Special mention to Lalikumar (pardon if the spelling is off) from the Courtyard. His attention to detail was highly commendable. Knowing that my family and I have certain dietary restriction, he went beyond his duty to cater to us by substituting the item in our high tea set.  All and all, thank you for the awesome stay and I look forward to another superb staycation at the Fullerton hotel, hopefully in the near future ☺️."
The best honeymoon start,Date of stay: September 2022,50,"What a stunning hotel! The staff couldn’t have done more to help us. Our room was beautiful and the bathroom was huge! Such a lovely touch being given a delicious cake to celebrate our honeymoon. The location is fantastic- walking distance to Fullerton bay and the embankment overlooking Marina Bay Sands. The breakfast was unbelievable- we had it once as it’s quite a hefty cost, but well worth it. If we return to Singapore (which we hope to do as we loved it), we will be sure to stay here."
Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: September 2022,50,Lovely hi-tea set. Live entertainment with wonderful harp performance with movie and Disney soundtracks We were happy to be served by Mr Lalikumar. The hi-tea were exquisite and delicious with variety of tea and coffee choices.
Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: September 2022,50,Lalikumar is of great service and friendly . Have a great day and enjoy ourselves here. Nice music and nice ambience. Good place to enjoy with friends and family. ........Thanks alot....................
Best for everything.,Date of stay: September 2022,50,"Stay in Quay Room at 7th floor. Beautifull view from balcony (but I have to climb the chair for the best view). We can see the two legendary bridges, Boat Quay, Asian Civilitation Museum, Parlement House, Raffles Statue, UOB tower etc. Beautifull view from swimming pool. And thank you for Sall (pool guard) , you are a good man, give me some information about everything.  The food, cakes are very delicious. The lunch buffet was so great. I love it. Thank you for give a slice cake for my husband (birthday slice cake). I love the herritage walk tour. Thank you for Linda, you are the good herritage tour guide.  Will be back again for sure."
Great location and grand hotel,Date of stay: September 2022,40,Stayed for 5 nights in a premier courtyard room. Room was refurbished. Bathroom was huge by Singapore hotel standards. I kept the curtains closed most of the time. I picked the Fullerton because I like hotels that have character. A lot of 5 star hotels in my opinion are soulless and the same. The location was fabulous for the things that interest me. Being so close to the Merlion and waterways was great. The train station is so close as well. The staff that stood out for me were the concierge and front door man. Sharing tips on quickest transportation routes etc. Breakfast was plentiful but I do wish it went to 11am instead of 10:30am. I like to sleep in on holidays. I was able to use facilities after check out such as showering which is extremely helpful when flights are late in the evening. The surrounding areas are pretty too at night. Boat Quay and Clarke Quay easy walks even in the humidity. I would stay again.
Fullerton Suite with family of four,Date of stay: September 2022,50,We booked a 1 night weekday staycation at the Fullerton for our family of four. The hotel is beautifully presented and the lobby staff are helpful and friendly. Check in was quick and easy. We received a upgraded suite on arrival (we were not told it was an upgrade at the desk but from the website pictures it looked like the Fullerton Suite). The suite had an very big balcony and a view onto the river and partially onto the bay/mbs. The main bed is very comfortable and my kids slept well on the sofa bed and additional roll out.  The service at the straits club was excellent and i particularly want to commend Crystal and Ryan for their attentiveness and level of service. Tip for the club level: check-in is at 3pm but first seating for afternoon tea is 1:30-3pm so if you wanted to arrive early you could relax with tea in the club while waiting for your room.  The pool is long and slightly rhonboid shaped and has a nice view onto the Singapore river. The water is warm so nice for kids. Not sure if it gets crowded on weekends.  Nice touch of a free scoop of ice cream for kids. Overall a big thumbs up and would love to stay again!
Fantastic Hotel and Location.,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"What a fantastic stay at The Fullerton,from arriving everyone made your welcome seem like you were of importance.location is superb,MRT for all places of interest and Boat Quay for food and drinks.Breakfast was superb and a great choice of food and service,room nice and airy,the toilet was very futuristic with all the gadgets.Would definitely recommend,and will always stay her when in Singapore."
Fabulous stay with family,Date of stay: September 2022,50,"My first stay at The Fullerton Hotel and I’m deeply impressed by the service, cleanliness and everything! Checkin was seamless and quick, and receptionist is considerate to ask me if my child is allowed ice cream before offering my 4 years old a name tag with lanyard (entitles her for 2 rounds of ice cream), crayons and activity book. My girl broke her crayons and was upset, and the receptionist happily offered her a new set together with the activity book much to her delight. When I called for a ‘flat’ pillow for my child, we were given a child pillow instead (which is exactly what we wished for), and we didn’t have to wait long for them to come over too. And impressively, we were greeted when we called for service. Wifi was speedy, although we don’t really need it. The infinity pool is beautiful, overlooking the waters. We requested for an extra bed, and it was all done up when we arrived in the room too. We were celebrating a birthday and we got a slice of chocolate cake (extra rich and yummy) delivered to the room. Oh… the breakfast buffet spread was fantastic, everything was so freshly prepared and beautifully set. Waitress was so quick to clear our used utensils and cutlery too. Check out was the fastest, by just returning the room keys. A wonderful heritage hotel that pays attention to every single details, that you’ll definitely feel so welcome, for locals and visitors!"
Singapore Holiday,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Another stay at The Fullerton Singapore, our 4th visit. It is always sad to leave the Fullerton because you feel so pampered during your stay. The staff are exceptional, friendly and never fail to go the extra mile to ensure that guests feel totally spoilt. The Fullerton is a classic colonial experience, centrally located and the perfect base to explore Singapore. My wife & I love escaping Australia’s cold winter and spending a week or so at the beautiful & friendly Fullerton Hotel in Singapore. We can’t wait to return :)"
"Heritage building, great location",Date of stay: August 2022,40,"Visited Singapore first time in August 22 post pandemic and stayed at this beautiful heritage hotel at the central location near financial district, While the external facade maintains its heritage character, it is quite modern internally. Had a smooth check in and check out experience, the rooms are large specious and have all the modern amenities The breakfast spread is excellent, the overall service levels are very good. The location of the hotel is excellent overlooking the Singapore river, with walking distance to financial district and Boat quay. The hotel is expensive and despite paying $ 400 we were given rooms on the internal side, overall if you like heritage building at central location it is great option in Singapore."
Fullerton Singapore,Date of stay: September 2022,50,"We have been to Singapore many times and really love the place. This time we treated ourselves to the Fullerton as on our other visits we would always come here for coffee. Our room was beautiful and comfortable and housekeeping were very good. We would like to give special thanks to Crystal, Ryan, Siti, Zep, Chiayi and Nicholas for their wonderful service in the Straits Cluba d of course the chef for the great food. The atmosphere there was very relaxing and friendly. Would definitely recommend a stay at this beautiful Hotel."
Excellence service!,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"This is my first time staying in Fullerton Hotel. The services are excellence. The team at the lounge is so professional and caring :)  Esp Nicholas - who remembered my meeting schedules and arranged for my breakfasts swiftly just to ensure that I have enough time for my meal and preparation for the meeting and also Crystal who gave me a memorable service - she gave me a scarf so that I won’t get cold, she remembered my favorite tea and always got me the perfect table (where the plugs are available) :))  Lastly, Juliet, the house keeping team, also saved my day by locating my missing Airpod case in the room. I literally didn’t expect that the hotel will find it (as I looked for it everywhere in the room (including the trash) lol).  I really enjoyed and had a pleasant stay here."
21 year reunion! 5 star all the way ✨️,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Having spent many months working in Singapore and staying at the Fullerton, I can honestly say it's improved on greatness. We had a gorgeous view, stunning breakfast and Christine and her staff were impeccable. We even got to shower and rest before our 1am flight after checking out. While it's a lot to spend, you're worth it."
"Great view, great location but not so clean",Date of stay: January 2022,30,"Great view & convenient location. Not recommended for families. We went for a staycation as a family.  Average Service by front desk - great service by checking out staff, not so pleasant experience with checking in staff.  Great service provided by staff at the restaurant where we had our breakfast. They were very welcoming and serving staff were very attentive and friendly  Plumbing issues - The bathtub was not able to drained out the water. We called the helpdesk and the plumber came to fix it. Took about 45-60mins.  Spider webs on fixtures.  Cleaniness of the room - Given the rather positive reputation of the hotel, we expected a little more but was quite disappointed. We requested for a baby cot but it was not so clean, we decided not to use it in the end. It was torn and stained with what seems to be saliva marks on the cot. We don't expect a brand new one but at least one that customers would feel comfortable to put their kids in.  Air-conditioning - The air conditioning didn't seem to work very well. We switched to a low temperature but it was still rather warm. We tried adjusting it a few times but to no avail.  Overall, not so pleasant stay in the room. Only saving grace were the staff at the restaurant where we had our breakfast."
Luxurious stay!,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Hotel room was excellent, with stunning views of Marina Bay. We also had the Joyous menu at Jade Restaurant and the high tea at Courtyard Cafe, both of which were sumptuous. The service was great too. When we were having high tea, there was also a harpist playing, which added to the nice ambience."
Complement,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"I will like to thank all the staff especilly samirah for excellent service and giving extra confortable bed, even though i only stayed for 1 night. Thanks for a good view room it was big and nice. I wil stay again if i can afford it. Thank you so much😃"
Rare gem in the hotel!,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"This is my second time staying in the hotel. I been greeted by Kate at the front desk with a smile. Even though my last stay was Jan last year, she recongise us and remember about our last visit. It feels like coming to a home. She ensure that the room has the best view and clean before handing the keys to us. The room was flawless with an amazing view. Her services is top notch perfect! Even during check out, i was served by another staff, she came to us and ask if everything is ok. She is definitely a gem of a hotel!"
Staycation,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Abigail, Bali Kumar and Ariel are very professional and friendly, they show passion at their work. We feel so welcoming and the experience in here is very pleasant and warm. Definitely will come again. Thank you!"
Holiday,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"We have stayed at The Fullerton Hotel Singapore before and as much as we have enjoyed our stay before, this time was even better. The Hotel is historic and beautiful, the staff are amazing and friendly and the service is unequalled from our experience around the world. Special thanks to Chai yi, Nicholas, Ryan, Siti, Crystal and Zep at the Straits Club who went above and beyond to make our stay incredible. We now regard these people as our friends. Sall at the pool is always fantastic and all of professional and friendly staff at The Fullerton Hotel. We will definitely be back soon!! Mark Wright"
First class accommodations,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"From Antonio Renolayan, I had a wonderful experienced at Fullerton Hotel. I’ve stayed at several hotels in Singapore but this was on the top of the list of best stay experiences ever. They have a high quality room and high quality of service. The customer service was superb. Every staff member I encountered from reservation Mr. Valent , Director of Sales was so prompt to respond to my inquiry, the Valet, cleaning staff to the check in more importantly to Darshawn and Katie Joe who were delightful and eager to help. They went over and beyond to make my stay comfortable and enjoyable. Darshawn ensure I’m satisfied with my room and well being while I’m an in house guest. Please give him a staff award for exceptional customer service. In addition, Cristina at the daily breakfast provided as well an exceptional service. She was very hospitable and there for every need of mine. BZ to Cristina. Thank you! Property has a fantastic old time charm. I highly recommend for anyone visiting Singapore."
National Day Weekend Celebration at the Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"We stayed here for a short vacation during Singapore's National Day. The Fullerton team had decked up the entire hotel in conjunction with the 57th Anniversary. We were delighted with old school local snacks and handed out flags and welcome with such a joyous occasion on the morning of the event. We received National day themed chocolates on the night before NDP. Overall, service was top notch. We would like to say thank you to the front office team who were very helpful all the way from the doorman, concierge and at the front desk. We hope to return next year to soak in the atmosphere."
"If you want to be spoiled rotten, then stay at The Fullerton Hotel Singapore!",Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Warning...booking a staycation at The Fullerton to celebrate your anniversary might make your other half look bad! The team really went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of right at the start when we checked in. From Shermaine at Front Desk, to Nicholas and his team at Straits Lounge, to even our entertaining guide who charmed my in-laws during The Heritage Tour we prebooked! It certainly won me brownie points with my in laws who I invited the next day to join us for lunch. Not to mention the sweet surprises we found in our room, including a thoughtful card by General Manager Gino Tan! With its picturesque backdrop, we took countless photos by the pool to capture our memorable stay. After which we headed down to feast on an elaborate Chinese meal at JADE where we admired the talented Chef's culinary works of art both in his cuisine AND his handmade pottery and dessert display. We did feel guilty leaving the kids at home so perhaps next time we will plan a family staycation and book the other heritage tours so that they can appreciate the historical beauty and its wonderful stories!  Thank you team! (My hubby thanks you too for making his job an easier one!)"
Impeccable Service,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"This is our third time staying as a staycation hotel. We have always highly recommend this hotel to friends and family.

Cordial and Satisfying Service,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Have been received by warm and friendly staffs at The Fullerton Hotel and is especially impressed by the service provided at the guest lounges. My partner and I were served by Crystal, Ryan and Marcel who have all been helpful and courteous the entire time we were there. Crystal was very knowledgeable about the hotel and surrounding areas which helped us in finding our way to MBS. While the atmosphere and beverages served at the lounge were wonderful, the food, however, was slightly bland for me but was alright for my partner. Given the chance again, I would come back for another stay."

"Comfortable, well located for business and renovated rooms.",Date of stay: July 2022,40,"Super location in the middle of CBD, if travelling for business. The room I stayed in had been renovated and was lovely (if without a window!). The service was generally good. The pool was very nice. The breakfast is fullsome.  Housekeeping was a little patchy with repeated reminders to get some earl grey tea not acted on. And in room dining stops at 10! They won’t even get you a hot chocolate after that time. But these are small niggles."
SUPER CLEAN,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Wonderful small Boutique Hotel in the center of Palau , amongst Restaurants Bars right in front of the harbor. They nail the most important factor, Super Clean , great beds and good breakfast. We have stayed in the Wellness suite , very elegant with Technogym accessories  At the bar they have great cocktails  Will be back for sure next year"

I was there for 3 nights with my family and for all these days I was attended with utmost warmth. I was impressed to see the prompt room service despite the peak season.  To senior front desk manager Shazwan, who has been nothing short of phenomenal. He is warm, friendly & professional. The genuine smile on his face when we moved into the presidential suite express his true interest in wanting us to be happy!

Helpful staff with great attitude!,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"A staff named Chandra was quick on his feet, upon seeing me with bulky baggage, hurried to help lessen my load, and assist me to book a taxi.  Ask to leave on floor but he Insisted on carrying my baggage."
Love this hotel!,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Everything about this hotel experience was 7 Stars, from the assistance by Warren at reception through to the wait staff in the restaurant- we could not have improved on anything - lots of unique little touches which added to the experience"
Fantastic hotel with staff who go above and beyond,Date of stay: May 2022,50,"After rebooking multiple times due to covid, we finally had a chance to stay at the Fullerton and it exceeded expectations in every way. The hotel is beautiful and historic, the location near Marina Bay can't be beat, and service was wonderful. Our very shy son really appreciated that the staff made an effort to connect with him and make him feel comfortable (and the daily free ice cream)."
A brief but extremely memorable staycation,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"My wife and I experienced our first staycation at the Fullerton Hotel recently. The entire Fullerton team made our stay a very memorable one. My deepest appreciation to the team at the Straits Club - Nicholas, Siti, Jared and Ryan - for making us feel so at home and encouraging us to sample the excellent spread served at the club. Ironically, we were a short distance away from our offices - but the tranquility of the room allowed us to disconnect from the hectic work life and enjoy a different perspective of the Raffles Place area! Special thanks goes to Nicholas - Robby made my day - he now sits proudly in my study at home."
"A Beautiful Hotel in a Great Location, But......",Date of stay: July 2022,30,"My sister and I spent 7 nights in Singapore at this beautiful hotel. The staff were lovely and very professional from the reception desk staff to the cleaners - everyone was lovely. The hotel is in a gorgeous old former post office building and is centrally located to all the wonderful sights of Singapore. However, our trip has been tarnished to a great degree by the email fight I have had to endure with The Fullerton Hotel's Finance Team and other staff to have the security deposit I paid for our room to be refunded into my bank account. It has now been over 4 weeks since we checked out of the Hotel and the deposit has not been refunded. Worse still, I have sent over 5 emails back and forth with the hotel trying to find out where my money has gone! To no avail, as I am still waiting for the money to be returned to my bank account. Now the Hotel is telling me that I have to prove with a letter from my bank that the money has not been returned to my account, instead of the Hotel getting their bank to prove to them the account name and details they say they have refunded the money into already!!!! I have been very patient up until now and I have never publicly complained about any Hotel in the past but feel that I have to do so now to shame this Hotel into returning my money promptly!!"
Amazing service at an amazing place,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Spent a night at the Fullerton Hotel on National Day to celebrate an occasion with my partner. We were absolutely impressed from pre-arrival till departure. The staff were extremely thoughtful, alert, and friendly. Impeccable service rendered from the first inquiry I made to the hotel. The room was clean, view was amazing, and have promised my partner to be back. The room was exceptionally cosy, and you could immediately feel like home from the very first step you take when you enter the room. Overall, we were both very satisfied with the cleanliness of the room, and more importantly, all the service crew that attended to us. You all have been amazing, which made our celebration a memorable one."
Martyn Phillips,Date of stay: August 2022,40,Good place to stay lovely surroundings. Great helpful staff and particularly in the Straits Club Jared great employee and most helpful. Close to some great eating places and attractions. Easy walk to Subway. Hotel is very clean and tidy. Masks have to be worn rhroughout except for eating and drinking . If I stay again I will request a room with a view as I had a high walled enclosed balcony with no view except high rises in the air.
Wedding Banquet,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Hi Fullerton Hotel Team,   I would like to compliment the excellent service that was rendered by Miss Zahera and Mr Ragu.   We held our wedding dinner banquet at Fullerton Hotel on 6th Aug 2022.   My special thanks to Zahera for taking the time to listen to all our requests during the pre event and making sure that all our expectations were met. And I mean 'all' of it really.

Staycation at The Fullerton,Date of stay: August 2022,50,My teen daughter and I booked a one night’s girls’ staycation just to chill. Upon arrival we were greeted personally and after an express check-in we were shown to our room which had a stunning view of the Singapore River (it was even better at night!). The reception staff Lucy proceeded to book our afternoon tea at The Courtyard for us and the offerings were delicious! We decided to stay in and binge watch movies and had in-room dining which was also served promptly and the pasta was done excellently. The next morning we headed to the buffet breakfast which offered a huge variety of both local and continental food - we only wished we had bigger appetites! All in all it was a lovely experience with personal touches from a wonderful team of staff (led by Mr Gino Tan) who were cheerful and professional and that made all the difference between a good experience and an exceptional one!
Great hotel and wonderful staff,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Great hospitality and service from the Fullerton hotel staff gives us a very memorable stay at the hotel. It starts from the Guest Relations desk when we arrive, it's a warm welcome from Kate Joe, she was very helpful and friendly, and even brought us up to the Straits Club to have our afternoon tea. Ms Sungeetha, hotel Guest Relations officer, was very thoughtful and caring, she took care of our meals at the Straits Club, really touched and appreciate. The food has a good mix of fusion and nostalgic local snacks, thus making our dinning an enjoyable and wonderful experience. The staff that were at the Strait's Club, Jared and Nicholas Wong are very pleasant and proactive, they recommended several good drinks and best teas which we have not tried before and also the Laksa and the Russian special, we would definitely come back again. Being here for the first time, the warm reception and great service really left a very good impression in us. Thanks to all the staff for making our time in the hotel a memorable one. The hotel location provides a scenic view at night, with the colourful night lightings at night, it's a beautiful place for taking night photos."
Truly the best service befitting this truly unforgettable stay!,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"We had a very memorable stay at the Fullerton hotel. It is our first time staying at Fullerton and the great hospitality blew us away.  Special mention to the Front Office Manager Darshan, who was very thoughtful to our needs during the stay, he was so kind to bring us around and his warm welcome and hospitality made us feel right at home. Darshan also brought us to the Straits Club where we had a taste of the lovely selection of delectables available at the Straits Club. The staff that were at the Straits Club, Jared, Crystal, Siti and Nicholas were especially warm and pleasant. Jared and Crystal recommended the best teas and checked on us throughout. The warm reception we received really left an impression on us. Thanks to all for making our stay so awesome!  Everyone at the hotel made us feel so welcomed and it was a lovely way to celebrate my husband’s birthday! We stayed at the Marina Bay View room and the view we had from the room was gorgeous. The fantastic location and the beauty of Fullerton’s historical building is truly unforgettable."
Went to Fullerton Hotel at Singapore,Date of stay: August 2022,50,We went there for short stay. We meet one waiter name Ryan. He quite nice & friendly guy. He quite a charming guy we like him to serve us. Fullerton hotel we went for twice. We love the hotel services. All front desk to housekeeping. They very polite. Amazing services that I had said. Keep it up Fullerton. Well done!!
Excellent stay,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Stayed for 6 nights at the Fullerton as part of a business trip. Staff were very welcoming and friendly throughout. They aided with covid tests in our room to meet HK requirements ie doctor came to our room rather than heading to Raffles medical and queuing. On arrival to our room realised that the courtyard room had no natural direct light and asked for alternates with direct light and was moved to an outward facing room for a very reasonable amount extra with ease. Facilities ie gym were great, swimming pool was nice but not many beds and you can’t order food which was frustrating when relaxing at the weekend before leaving but equally not a deal breaker (drinks can be served). The breakfast experience was probably the worst part of the stay. It was very manic most mornings and the coffee machine was often broken for periods and when it did work it was very slow. It would be good to see options for coffee/tea brought to your table. Also the bread for tasting was sweet and so an options of fresh cut bread would be good and also there wasn’t orange juice every morning and was only available twice during my stay and so have orange juice available everyday. That said this didn’t materially impact my experience. Will stay again and look forward to doing so."
Amazing accommodation,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Thank you Darshan, Lucy & Nicolas who gave us a pleasant surprise for our anniversary. Really touched and appreciate it! Staff are friendly and attentive. Amazing view. Buffet variety was a spread. Recommend for any occasion!"
Fullerton full of Fun,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"We were apprehensive about our staycation at the hotel because there were 5 of us. Two adults and 3 kids. It’s hard to be discreet with such a large troop but Darshan (the front office manager) on duty and his team were ever so ready to make us feel right at home with ice cream, plush toys and colouring book for our kids.  When we went for dinner later that evening, the kids were famished after their swim. We told the staff on duty to prepare something that was not on the menu as our daughter is a fussy eater. To our surprise they did as we asked and my daughter enjoyed her meal thoroughly.  On the whole this was a great getaway and the staff who were ever so friendly played a monumental part in making our stay at the Fullerton an epic one."
Great hotel and wonderful experience in the heart of the city,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Great food at the Town Restaurant. Sat outside by the river with a great view. It was a wonderful experience. The food was delicious, love the variety of the dessert (that's my main focus :P). The staff was sincere. It was a great night."
Definitely one of the best in Singapore,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"the whole experience when staying at this hotel was fantastic! from the hassle free check in, the request for a late check out and the eventual check out was hassle free and fast. food during breakfast was very good with a lot of variety to choose from. location is probably the best factor of the hotel since it is near everything"
Great hotel but gym no Fitness Instructor,Date of stay: July 2022,30,"Great hotel and located at strategic location. Breakfast was great. Room was Superb and Service by all associates at lobby were outstanding. Unfortunately as compared with other hotels around in Singapore, it's quite disappointed that this hotel don't have Fitness Instructor like at Mbs and Pan Pac."
Wonderful experience at Fullerton Hotel restaurant,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Went here last Thursday for the buffet, the food is superb and have lots of choices! The staff were very friendly and accommodating especially Princess who always check what we need and if everything is okay. Overall, will recommend this to family and friends!"
A hotel you should not miss if you visit Singapore,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"A very pleasant stay last week. Room was spacious and had great Boat Quay view. A beautiful historical building and nicely decorated room with taste. The room got everything you needed with your own Dolce Gusto coffee machine. Enjoy the outdoor view at the balcony with your cup of coffee.  Staying in Fullerton was a good memory. No doubt with the hardware. More important was the feel and services you obtained here. Every staff had a sweet and smiling face. You got a home feeling here. Thanks to all the Fullerton staffs and small thank you to Warren at reception, Ryan and Crystal at The Straits Room who gave me laugh during my visit."
Club was Fabulous!,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"This was our 4th visit to the Fullerton and was made more special as they now have a Club and an excellent one too. We remember our last visit because of the special welcome we received, I still remember the guys welcoming smile when he took us to our room. This was a completely different experience, masks so no smile and no intro to your room. I did think we had made a mistake coming back,that was until we visited the Club, welcoming smiles (even though still behind masks!). We would like to thank the whole team, especially Ryan and dear Crystal Lye who made us so welcome on each occasion. Crystal will be the lady we remember just like the guy who checked us in on our last visit. Thank you Crystal."
Very attentive and warm service at Fullerton Hotel Jade and Straits Club,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"My sister and I had a lovely staycation at the Fullerton hotel. The hospitality team at Straits Club of Nicholas Wong, Crystal, Marcel and team were very kind and attentive, thoughtful in going out of their way to make us feel very welcomed. Nicholas even took the initiative to make us a nice cocktail. We had dinner at Jade and Alan IP was very good with his food and drinks recommendation, and was very nice to chat with. We will be back again to Jade and Fullerton, a charming place with great hospitality. Many thanks for the lovely experience."
"Fabulous stay at the Fullerton, champagne edition",Date of stay: July 2022,50,"We had access to the straights clan for afternoon tea, cocktail hour and champagne breakfast. Everything was perfect, and service above and beyond even with small children in tow! Crystal and Joshua were particularly amazing so a special shout out to them!"
Top Notch Stay at the Fullerton,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"The Fullerton Hotel Singapore is a beautiful, amazing hotel! It was our first trip to Singapore and by the time we left we felt like we were leaving our home—the hotel and its staff are welcoming, attentive, and accommodating. The building, rooms, and amenities are top notch, clean, and luxurious. The food, especially considering one person in our party had dietary restrictions, was delicious, especially the afternoon tea. We were so impressed that a daily breakfast buffet and one afternoon tea were complimentary with our 6 night stay. The location is perfect—within walking distance to so many amazing sights, a bus stop right outside the hotel, and an MRT station very close. I can't recommend The Fullerton Hotel Singapore enough!"
Great Choice But Tweaks are Needed,Date of stay: July 2022,40,"Fullerton Hotel was a terrific choice. Elegant property with great service in an amazing location downtown in Singapore right on the canal. Tweaks that hotel needs to make are the following: -Food needs to move up a notch in terms of sophistication. Buffet breakfast is expensive at $45 per person. There should also be an a la carte option. Salmon burger, yikes, was pieces of nova with lettuce and tomato. -Singapore can be very hot weather. Outdoor pool was too warm and they need to pump cold water into it."
Lovely Hotel,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Wow! This hotel is amazing. If you believe in Fung Shui, I was told that everything here is according how the hotel is set up. The staircase alone is massive and beautiful. Different type of koi swim in the beautiful pond under the staircase. The washroom is so elegant. It is worth visiting this hotel if you’re in Singapore."
Great to be Back!,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Our first trip to Singapore since the borders re-opened. Where else would we want to stay but the Fullerton! It was nice to see familiar faces and some new ones too. Siti and Paolo in the Straits Club were excellent in looking after us. Yes, there have been changes as you would expect after three years of the pandemic, but they are all for the better. We had a Quay room and a great view overlooking the Singapore River. We were told that the breakfast buffet had recently been reintroduced and it works well. There are no physical menus anymore so you have you scan the QR codes to get the menu choices. The Fullerton is well placed for the MRT and then you can go anywhere the fancy takes you. Will we go back to the Fullerton? - most definitely!"
Blessed Birthday 2022 @Town Fullerton,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"3 years ago we had our simple wedding breakfast and short ROM at this very place. Tonight, I am celebrating my birthday and the staffs are as welcoming and warm as then. Service is top notch. Kind and helpful staffs. Would like to mention Heidi, the lady who helped us through the night. We can feel her patience and care the whole time. The chef was so kind to attend to our additional requests... And shout out to the Pinoy staffs, too! Hospitality is 💯! Overall a lovely night! Kudos to the team! Definitely ... recommended place to create memories. ❤️❤️❤️"
The Straits Club at The Fullerton is exceptional,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Extraordinary service and tranquility of The Straits Club makes our two recent stays an exceptional travel experience. The sanctuary of the Straits Club is created by the warm attentive and professional service of Nicholas, Siti, Crystal and Lucy. Check in and out is seamless and pleasant, early breakfasts with suburb omelette s and afternoons with a lazy class of champagne are features of our stay, and concierge service that arranged sought after dinner and car reservations are to be commended. The highest recommendation."
"My kid's dream hotel! The rooms, service, location and facilities are the best!",Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Staycation in The Fullerton Hotel was a wonderful experience. The room was spacious and clean. Loved the design style which is very classic. Our room also has a beautiful view of Marina Bay. There is a small balcony outside and we chill and had a drink outside during the night which was pretty nice. The location of the hotel is very convenient. We could walk to the Merlion via the underpass and walk along the shore. It was beautiful and a nice walk with a small flower garden along the bay. We went to the swimming pool in the afternoon and there weren't too many people. The pool wasn't too big but enough for the kids to enjoy and had fun. It is also an infinity pool facing the river, which is quite nice and quiet. We enjoyed relaxing by the poolside. We tried their signature cake from the lobby for our afternoon tea, it was delicious! The overall experience was wonderful and the kids really enjoyed their first staycation. My daughter would call this her second home! Thank you to all the welcoming staff who gave us a wonderful memory."
"The best of the best! The food, the rooms, the service, the people, the location.",Date of stay: July 2022,50,"It was our first time in Singapore and the Fullerton was the keystone in making the trip the most memorable of our lives and it defined what a 5 star experience should feel like. From the moment we walked in at dawn on the first day, the staff made us feel like special VIP guests. Rey in the restaurant was especially attentive. The hotel is spectacular from the moment you enter. We had a room overlooking the river with views of the city from our balcony on the 7th floor that I highly recommend. Sit outdoors for breakfast and enjoy a mimosa and a cool breeze before the heat gets intense. You can walk everywhere from the Fullerton, and it’s close (18 minute walk) to Marina Bay Sands, the Gardens at Marina Bay, and china town, so the location is ideal. The Fullerton has a rich history, being the original Post Office in Singapore, and it’s opulence as a hotel is renowned. If you have only one chance in your life to come to Singapore, then the Fullerton is the one choice you should make. Singapore is a fairly expensive city, but the Fullerton is worth every cent. We will be sending family and friends here in the future, and we hope to return ourselves!"
My Second Home,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Decided to book this hotel due to its proximity near my office at Raffles. Wasn't disappointed as from the point of arrival, during my staff of 7 days, it was faultless. I also enjoyed the service at the Straits Club and found all the staff at front office were friendly and help me oriented myseld and feel at home.  The hotel has some strong heritage and history. Do visit the heritage trail and take the free tours when you can. The concierge will also be able to give you some great suggestions and recommendations of where to dine and have cocktails. It would be great if the management could arrange corporate shuttle services to key office areas within the business district.  Lastly, please convey my appreciation to all your wonderful staffs from the Housekeeping, Front Desk and many othes whom I met during my stay. You are assured that I will return to stay at my 2nd home."
Paradise in the city!,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Fast check in by staff into a beautiful room that is very comfortable with a fantastic view of Marina Bay Area. Bathroom is beautifully appointed and spacious.  Housekeeper did a wonderful job of turning down the bed for my evening’s rest. The sun set and sun rise was spectacular as it gave a the Marina Bay Area. The reflection of lights on the Bay made it a wonderful sight!  Staff at the Straits Club are very friendly and warm making it very homely with their casual talk and they offered advice on what to do during my stay.  I liked the art work that are displayed around the hotel. A blend of local and modern pieces provided an interesting outlook. My room had heritages pieces that gave an interesting history about the buildings heritage.  The lobby is well decorated as it gives a guest more information about the heritage of the building. Good bar and I enjoyed the Jade Restaurant, seeing Chinese cuisine. Very good food.  The hotel has a good location as it is convenient to walk around to do sightseeing.  A great hotel that is conveniently located with comfortable rooms and facilities giving guest a luxurious feeling.  I will be back, thanks for a restful stay and I learnt about the history of the hotel as well as the area.  Complemented with warm and helpful staff that made me feel like I was at home!"
Outstanding service and professionalism,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Our family had started to stay in this hotel since 2015 every time we came to Singapore and most recently is on 11 of July 2022.  The service is excellent and the staff are so nice, polite and professional especially full respect for their guests.  The rooms are super clean and always look new to us and the entire property always smell so nice and fresh.  They are so quick to fulfil your request every time we called room service and you always see the smiles on their faces.  We would rate them 6 stars if I could if there is another star available to click on.  If you have a late flight on the day, they are quite generous to allow you to check out late without any charges. We love it  We definitely without a doubt will come back here again and again.  We strongly recommend everyone to try this hotel next time you’re in Singapore and I’m absolutely sure that you will come back again."

Great Short Staycation!,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"It's a last minute booking for a long weekend in SG and to view the National Day Preview fireworks from our room for our 4 year old son.  We booked a Straits Club Marina Bay View Room as that's one of the only option left in Trip.Com. Was actually looking at Marina Bay View with Balcony but unfortunately that room was sold out but nevertheless, it was an awesome staycation. We got access to the Straits Club for Champagne Breakfast, Afternoon Tea & Evening Canapés and we loved it especially my son.  Check in was smooth and quick. My son got a free pass for a scoop of ice cream at Town Restaurant and a set of crayons and Fullerton colouring book! Front Desk who I didn't get his name said the room we assigned to doesn't have a full view of the Fireworks but its all good during the Preview, great view of the fireworks, we got to watch helicopter flying passed us Infront of the room etc etc. Hope we will be back here again with Marina Bay View with a balcony!"
"Bachelorette's party -- incredible service, location, view!!!",Date of stay: July 2022,50,"My sisters threw me a bachelorette's surprise staycation at the Fullerton -- being able to stay in this iconic, beautiful heritage hotel was amazing, but what really impressed me was how well taken care of we were. My sisters told me that Shazwan from Fullerton went out of his way to make sure the surprise was well-orchestrated after they made the booking, and even after check-in, there were so many little surprises from the hotel that really demonstrated how considerate and attentive Shazwan was. It made the surprise staycation so memorable, and we had such a good time. Looking forward to coming back for another stay in the future!!"
Most amazing staycation,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"We are soo thankful for the stay at Fullerton, everything was so well taken care of, and special shoutout to Shazwan who made the stay really pleasant because of his hospitality and sweet disposition ◡̈ My family really appreciated his attention to detail and it made our hotel stay my best one, hands down. Thank you ◡̈"
Payment issue resolved,Date of stay: June 2022,30,"In my previous review (which i had to delete in order to make an upate to my review), I shared about how I was being wrongly billed (charged 2 times the original amount) for my 3D2N stay at the Palladian Suite.  After calling to clarify, the hotel responded via a call after 2 days by front office manager, Darshan Lionel. Though I would appreciate for the call to be made much earlier, I would like to thank Darshan for addressing this payment issue. He gave me a direct number to contact him and tried to expedite the refund. He also followed up with messages to check on the status of the refund. After the refund was made, Darshan offered my family a complimentary dinner buffet at the Town restaurant to compensate for the unpleasant experience. He was professional in managing my case and was helpful.  While I am not sure if my family would want to book a stay with Fullerton again, I am thankful that the matter has been resolved. The inconvenience I faced due to the overcharged bills on my credit card was a bad experience. It was a mistake that the hotel should not have made. I hope no other customers will have to face similar issue of being wrongly billed."
Great location and room quality,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"This hotel has an amazing location with views of the Marina Sands and easy walkability to many riverside restaurants. The service is impeccable, rooms are very well serviced and maintained, and the breakfast has a lot of variety and is very tasty. I would definitely stay here again the next time that I'm in Singapore."
Decent stay,Date of stay: July 2022,40,"My partner and I booked Quay room and got upgraded (thank you!), stayed for one night at the Marina Bay View Roomthe room was of decent size with balcony. Enjoyed the pool and spa facilities a lot! Breakfast spread was decent too, will be back in near future"
Family staycation in June 2022,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"It was wonderful! My girls loved it, husb loved the massage and most importantly, the staff were helpful and friendly, especially Lucy (hope I remembered her name correctly). My 6yo was completely in awe with her. The high tea and evening cocktail were fantastic too 😂 Highly recommended"
Underwhelming,Date of stay: June 2022,30,"Just disappointing as we expected nothing but excellent service. Very underwhelmed with the whole experience. We were out for the full day and came back to an uncleaned rook. It took 45 minutes to resolve but then no one informed us it was finished, we had to chase staff to find out if we could go back to the room."
Welcoming and good service.,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"My second time staying here. Overall experience was pleasant and my family enjoyed their stay. Staff were friendly and provided us with good service.  For the breakfast buffet, there was a variety of dishes. Definitely worth it."
"Good hardware, room to improve software",Date of stay: July 2022,40,"Second stay at this hotel and last year’s stay was way better than this year.  Felt like there was a lack of warmth from staff and that service just wasn’t as 5 stars as we expect it to be.  The hotel have done a fantastic job maintaining the hotel, but there’s much more to be done for the staff."
Good!,Date of stay: June 2022,50,I think it was very good in service and hotel's quality. Room service and Infinity pool was very good and location of hotel was also very good. And i'd like to thanks to the all the staffs in working in the hotel because of their hospitality and kindness.
Singapore Trip,Date of stay: July 2022,50,Can’t fault the hotel on accommodation and cleanliness excellent …only problem room service finishes at 11pm and you can’t get a coffee in the foyer after 5pm…breakfast was good only drawback was coffee is out of a machine so I asked for a fresh cup at the table which they did …
Room and toilet was beautiful,Date of stay: June 2022,40,The toilet was my favourite features as the toilet seat opens automatically when it senses you are near. The toilet seat is powered to be hot and the there is a remote to control the pressure of the water which is hot also. Bathtub was spacious
Great old dame and great location,Date of stay: June 2022,40,Great location and the rooms are in good condition and well cleaned by the friendly staff members.  We had access to both the Straits Club and main dining area. Less on offer in the Straits Club for breakfast. We also had on offer afternoon tea and pre-dinner cocktails.  Would be nice if greater range of drinks etc was on offer around the pool.  Recommend returning.
The most comfortable luxurious hotel,Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Our experience at The Fullerton Hotel is nothing short of perfection. Check-in was relatively easy. When we arrived in our rooms, we were amazed at every aspect of comfort. Comfy-sized rooms, beds, bathrooms with nespresso machine, Harman Kardon speaker & power adapter to fit almost any plug you need"
Great Service,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Staff upon my arrival was super helpful and approached me even before I made it to the front desk. Rooms were clean and spacious, and all staff were friendly during the entire process - even at the pool and breakfast."
Great Experience,Date of stay: June 2022,50,Love the whole experience. Excellent service and overall cleanliness of the room. Visited the pool and it was enjoyable. Would love to visit this hotel again and would recommend it to my family and friends!
Pleasant stay,Date of stay: June 2022,40,"Good location, clean hotel and friendly staff. Very big room and bathroom. Was given a cake to celebrate our anniversary. Nice personal touch from the hotel! Just find the pillows too soft for my liking."
Perfect,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"This hotel is very comfortable and clean place to stay, also staffs are very friendly and kind. Great location, so easy to go anywhere. Night view is also perfect. I'm highly recommended this hotel to visit Singapore."
Great historic hotel,Date of stay: June 2022,50,At the the mouth of Singapore in a buzzing area. Beautiful iconic hotel. Large lobby area and restaurant at one end over looking the river/Boat Quay. Large bar With whiskey focus. Small shops and friendly staff. Small history area of Singapore that is really interesting
Excellent hotel,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Our stay was wonderful, pleasant and excellent.All the staff was very helpful, friendly and provide excellent customer services. We really enjoy our stay. Will definitely go back there to stay again next time:)"
"Good, but not great",Date of stay: June 2022,40,"5 star, not yet. 4 star maybe. 3 stars plus for sure. Much room for improvement. There are many keen Competitors around. Need to stand out from the crowd. It is the attention to detail, small things that make you stand out from the crowd."
Staycation,Date of stay: June 2022,50,Great location and hotel ambience is great. Friendly and great service of hotel staff. Breakfast food with plenty of selection and tasty. Nice view from the hotel room and also at swimming pool. Overall great staycation with family
I will be back (thumbs up picture),Date of stay: June 2022,50,"The trip was somewhat a last minute event for a wedding, as the booking was too. As it was my first time staying in Fullerton, let alone a premium establishment, i can say I was truly impressed and enjoyed my stay. Definitely worth every penny, and will be back staying here next time visiting Singapore."
A decent Hotel in a good location,Date of stay: June 2022,40,"The room was very nice, albeit a more expensive Esplanade Room. We were surprised at that price, we had no lounge access. Staff seemed a little slow and less attentive than we are used to in Hong Kong."
Tampons at the front! Attention to detail is negliable.,Date of stay: June 2022,10,"Where do I start and for full disclosure, I will be honest. I stayed here as apart of ht AMEX promotion that I was offered a free night here and I took it. What struck me first was how useless the doormen were. I dont understand why they are there when they watch you take your bag out of the car. While this isnt a problem, they did watch me, something which I find uncomfortable if they see me.  I then at check in asked for an upgrade at check in, with the AMEX promotion offering me an internal courtyard room. I wasnt a room that had an outdoor area, I was offered an Esplanade room for 50++ and then offered a Collyer Quay Suite for 300++. i took the former, having been promised it had an outside aea, and WOW, it had solid brick walls in front of the windows. If you dont believe my comments, believe my guest who asked, ""what are these th9ngs in front of the windows"". BEWARE, there is no view. The sad thing here is that I was upsold on a dream, and delivered a dud.  The Straits Club was fine, everything was ok there.  Finally, upon checkout, like most hotels I am finding I seeing thay will try and wingle every cent out of you they can. As I had a suite, I was promised 2 pieces of free pressing, and i gave the hotel my suit. At check out, that laundry was charged at SGD30, alongside the suite upgrate, and then when I asked about it, It was swiftly taken away.  For a hotel of this calliabre,this is unacceptable. why when asking out do I need to ask. Attention to detail vs. Revenue raising?  I also have a huge problem that there is no 24/7 room service. While I am living in Singapore. tuere are some people who would like a warm meal at unreasonable hours; when asked, i was told ""you need to use Grab, kitchen is closed:. What is the point of staying at the Fullerton if its the same as the holiday in.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,And Finally, ther ewere tampons at the front of the hotel. I cannot express the lack of attention to detail which this exemplies. It wasnt that hard to see them, I was shcoked and they were in of the attached photo colours. Shall I just leave a condorm in the front of the hotel next time?"
I LOVE MY STAY!,Date of stay: June 2022,50,I had a splendid stay with The Fullerton Hotel for my honeymoon! The service was great and the room was fantastic. I look forward to book another stay with Fullerton Hotel very soon. This will not be my last stay with them! Thank you! 🤗
Staycation,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"A short but enjoyable staycation! An iconic hotel, centrally located and close to main attractions. Comfortable rooms, well equipped, clean and quiet. Staff were calm, friendly, polite and professional. Enjoyed the buffet dinner in The Town Restaurant."
Amazing hotel and location,Date of stay: June 2022,40,"Everything is five star. Staff is amazing. Location is the best. The rooms are clean, big and very comfortable. Room for improvement on breakfast. Its ok but could decently be better to meet the rest of the hotel standard."
A normal experience,Date of stay: June 2022,40,"Pros: a classic and vintage design hotel that make you feel the old days of singapore, marina bay view room has a balcony to observe the night view of marina bay Cons: cleanliness-dust could be found on cabinet, price is a bit overpriced for whole experience during the stay"
Superb Heritage Hotel,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Great hotel, excellent location close to Marina Bay and theCBD. Vey helpful and friendly staff. Bedrooms are well appointed and beds very comfortable. Breakfast buffet options and quality of food on offer is very good."
Five days of fun in Singapore,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"My wife and I spent 5 days here in mid-June. It has a lot of history and the decor is very attractive and reflects the high standing of this iconic building. It is very well located and a short walk or taxi ride to many things and places in Singapore.  The Highlight for us was the Straits Club. Super people looking after us - Lucy and Jared were names we recall, though everyone in the Club was superb.  The sea or river view rooms are best - the Courtyard rooms haven’t much of a view. One criticism is rather dark corridors.  The breakfasts were excellent - Omelette chefs especially good.  When we stay again - as we certainly will - we will ask for the river view ( more goings on) and be a member of the Straits Club, which not only has lovely canapés and drinks, but the exceptionally fine staff will help with all kinds of things - advice, bookings, copying, and much else.  It’s a fine place to stay."
Nice Trip,Date of stay: June 2022,50,I had a very good experience with my children during our stay in June holiday. The staff there are very friendly and helpful. I like the hotel environment so much. It is elegant and tasteful. My children enjoyed themselves and didn’t even want to leave.
Beautiful Heritage Hotel,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"We stayed at the Premier Collyer Suite with Straits Club benefits. The 65 sqm room is very beautiful with a very spacious living area, luxurious bed-room and bathroom. Straits club benefits comes with champagne breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapés and cocktail. Service is very good, however the spread of food could be improved."
Luxury and Taste,Date of stay: June 2022,50,Beautiful hotel with well-appointed taste in decor. Staff were friendly and willing to help. The pool was stunning and has beautiful outlooks over the river and city view. Would definitely stay again. Comparable to MBS but with a more tasteful appointment of rooms.
"Enjoyed my stay, amazing accommodation and service at the Strait’s Club",Date of stay: June 2022,50,All the staff are extremely accommodating and polite! Nicholas went above and beyond and helped us with all our administrative matters! Well done!  We had such an enjoyable time and would definitely come back!
Excellent hotel,Date of stay: June 2022,50,An excellent experience that I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a 5 star experience in Singapore. The staff were very helpful and friendly at all times and the location of the hotel provides easy access to much of the city's main attractions.
Wonderful local staycation,Date of stay: June 2022,50,It was marvellous. Brought my child along who is below 12yrs old. The facilities are child friendly. Complimentary bed for children below 12. The marina bay view room was beautiful. The pool faces the boat quay which is another nice view. The pool at night was warm.
Wonderful Service in Beautiful Setting,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Everyone in the hotel were super attentive, friendly and efficient. The rooms were always impeccably cleaned. We love the breakfast buffet - especially the local food of Nasi lemak and laksa - and of course the usual staples of a full English breakfast. We stayed there for almost two weeks and towards the end, everyone was calling us by name. We had a chance to use the pool, and it was really unique to swim in the evening right next to the Singapore river and watch the lights as they came on. There were several of us and we took different room types and all of the rooms were amazing. As a heritage hotel, the fullerton has managed to retain the old world atmosphere with the modern conveniences. The best of both worlds. I could not recommend this higher."
Hotel review,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"The esplanade room is a good size for family staycation. But unfortunately, the plants outside had blocked of the beautiful view. View of the marina bay room is impeccable. Good service overall! Will definitely recommend the esplanade room to family. Spacious and nice"
Lovely stay,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"We had a much needed mini vacation in between our flights moving overseas from Australia to Europe. The staff was very attentive and welcoming and we felt well taken care of. The location is great and many of the top sights are walkable. Our Marina Bay View room had a lovely view of the bay and we watched the light show on our balcony two nights in a row. Would definitely stay again for a longer period of time! If you are thinking about visiting Singapore, this would be my recommendation."
What an experience,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Had a one night stay from 18-19 June 2022 at The Fullerton Hotel.  The moment I stepped within 50 metres from the hotel I could feel that this one is gonna be different, it has been a while since I last stepped into a hotel ever since ahem ahem (you know), but everything at The Fullerton made me feel like the travel scene has never left! The place was lively, the lobby was filled with people, the lounge was almost full house, there was even a short queue at the front desks! (It was really a very short wait so don’t be alarmed by that hahaha) the front office agent was able to answer every need and queries that I had raised, of course as expected, the check in process was super efficient and I was in the elevator up to my room in minutes.  Room service was super quick, phone calls are picked up within 3 rings, and you get what you ask for - a five star experience.  The facilities and amenities at the hotel also surprised me, from the very tech-oriented gym facilities to the good view of the Singapore River from the swimming pool when the sun was setting, I must say that I have had a very good afternoon indeed.  Oh did I mention that the bed was super comfortable? Yes, I usually can’t fall asleep easily when I’m away from my own bed, but hey I don’t know what magic Fullerton is casting onto their mattresses, but it works like magic, you should try it for yourself for those of you reading this before making a decision if Fullerton is the one for you, all I can say is that this would be a life changing experience for you.  Deciding to not use the express check out option and going to the front desk to say bye to the front office agents is another good decision I have made out of the few that I’ve made during this stay, the agents were so friendly and kept checking that everything was perfect and whether I have had a good night sleep, and most importantly they asked not once, not twice but 3 times if they gave me a parking coupon(3 different person asked me of course) I was really impressed by how the service culture is so deeply rooted in every single person that I’ve met during the stay.  From the moment I arrived at The Fullerton to the moment I stepped out of the iconic Revolving Door one more time, every single interaction with the people at Fullerton I could only describe with one word - WOW  Thank you Team Fullerton for one of the most memorable stays I’ve had in a long long time, would definitely be back!"
Anniversary celebratory staycation,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"We had a memorable wedding anniversary staycation at the Fullerton Hotel.  It was a long-awaited, yet familiar, experience to be having the breakfast buffet again. The range of food choices was sufficient and of good quality; I look forward to the return of the local breakfast set soon.  We were most touched by the personal care given by the team at the Fullerton Hotel, which made the celebration even more magical!"
Fabulous Location,Date of stay: June 2022,40,"Beautiful Hotel although a little tired in some areas. Great location. Room was lovely, clean, great bed linen & pillows. Club access was average, this room seemed like an afterthought. Food selection was disappointing but the staff excelled. Breakfast was good but nothing special, could have changed local signature dishes each day. Swimming pool lounge area cramped . Overall a lovely hotel."
Great staycay!,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"A lovely extended family staycay, with old folks, adults and teens. Great hotel, service and staff. We had the Courtyard rooms which are spacious and clean. Bathroom/toilet is clean and big. The feather/down pillows get a bit too soft over time, so stack them up. Toiletries and amenities provided are good. Gym lacks some weight equipment while the pool is an average-sized rectangle. Good that there’s chilled orange/lemon-infused drinking water provided at the poolside. Kids below 12 can get a daily free scoop of ice cream. Meals are a bit expensive but there are also lots of dining options in the vicinity. Easy walking distance to the promenade across from MBS and ArtScience Museum for photo-taking, and a short walk to Merlion Park. Hotel is also just across the Cavenagh Bridge to the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Victoria Concert Hall. Situated in the Central Business District, it’s near to banks and offices, and the MRT. We’ll be back for next staycay!!"
Most memorable stay,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"The service provided at Fullerton Hotel was impeccable. We were impressed by the hospitality shown by Fullerton's staff - Anne and her team were accommodating to our needs as we prepared for our wedding. We were well taken care of and had a wonderful time. The views at the Governer Suite were impressive and amazing, which allowed us to have a bird's eye view of the city skyline. We appreciate the complimentary upgrade, which allowed our photographer to capture beautiful photos for our wedding. Overall, we had a good time and we hope to be back again soon."
Perfect Family Stacay! 3rd time we're here!,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"As usual, the service staff were friendly and very efficient throughout from check in to check out. We got the Marina Bay view Room and it was beautiful!!  Our kids love this hotel so much that this is like the 3rd time (if I recall correctly) that we're here for a staycay. There's plenty to do around the area too!"
Good to stay,Date of stay: June 2022,50,Thanks for the staff assist and allow us for our early check in due to our ROM date on that day. We are happy their friendly and helpful service during our stay. We got the stay during the promotion and worth to stay.
Our 2nd staycation in 6 months,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Room is spacious for 3 of us. Previously we had the Fullerton street view but this time our room is in the inner wing. Request for toiletries for 3rd person took quite long, claiming to be busy that weekday afternoon. Overall a relaxing experience as we're not allocated near families with young children. Internet connection was reliable and we could all work and study at same time."
Excellence service at Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: June 2022,50,Enjoyed excellent service with the hotel front counter staff who tried their best to find us a great room & very warm hi-tea staff at The Courtyard within the Fullerton Hotel. Will be back for our 5th stay again!
Birthday treat!,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"I celebrated my 60th birthday here. Checking in was a breeze with efficient staff. I was surprised with a bunch of birthday balloons with Fullerton teddy bear, yummy and a chocolate cake. The hotel is nostalgic as many portraits and paintings donning the walkways. Room overlooking the Singapore River was beautiful. It was definitely a wonderful stay. Will come back for sure!"
Stay Here,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Had a wonderful 7 night stay. Had a Marina Bay room, excellent views of the harbour. Staff were wonderful and nothing was too much trouble. Had buffet breakfast, which was relaxed and a wide variety of choice. The hotel is a beautiful historic building and rooms are well appointed. Location is on Marina with lots to see and do. Would recommend Boat Quay area for dinner."
Staycation,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Had booked the Marina Bay View room. There was a promo for complimentary night. Thus had booked for 3Days 2 nights. View was over seeing the Merlion and floating platform. Happen to be the 1st rehearsal. Althot no fireworks but saw many ""rehearsals"" of the air and sea show in a day."
Great Hotel,Date of stay: June 2022,50,Service and staffs were excellent. Bedding was very comfortable and location was excellent. Staffs were very friendly especially the front desk and the concierge. The price was a bit high though. Definitely recommended.
Home Away from Home,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Though our room was available at 4ish, staff did his best to compensate with late checkout and assign a corner room which is slightly more spacious. Our room overlooks the bridge and is just beside the pool. So convenient! All the staff that we encountered are polite and helpful. Room decor is chic and very clean. Thankful for the Complimentary roll away bed for our kid. Bathroom is huge and tub is big and of good depth for a good soak. Location of hotel is also very good with plenty of eateries within walking distance. Wish we could have stayed longer. Will be back!"
Overnight stop to break up journey.,Date of stay: June 2022,50,Exceptional service. We stayed in a lovely quiet room overlooking the internal courtyard. The hotel is within walking distance of many tourist areas even for two 70 year olds like my husband and I. The staff are very friendly and helpful on the front desk. We would definitely recommend The Fullerton.
Memorable and insightful heritage stay!,Date of stay: June 2022,50,Take the Monument Tour! It provides a lot of historical background to the hotel’s beginning and allows us to have a greater appreciation of what we are seeing and where we are staying! Heritage room on the 2nd floor is kept in its original since the beginning! Very beautiful!
Staycation at Fullerton Hotel and high tea at The Courtyard,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Lakikuma (team manager), Fabian and the team were very attentive and provided and enjoyable experience for the family during our high tea at The Courtyard.  Also kudos to the staff (Sharon) and team at the Fullerton hotel for making our stay a memorable one while we celebrated our 13th anniversary.  We enjoyed the tour and learnt so much about the history of Fullerton and Singapore.  The room was clean and great amenities provided, well deserving of being a five-star luxury hotel."
Fullerton Hotel June 2022,Date of stay: June 2022,50,Excellent hotel in an historic building. Every room seems to be unique. The rooms have lots of character as does the main lobby. The location is great. The food is excellent with a lot to choose from. The staff is friendly and professional at all times.
Wonderful Straits Club Experience,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"kids and i have always loved our staycation at Fullerton Hotel. This time, we booked the Pallidium Suite to celebrate my wedding anniversary with my hubby.  There was a dedicated check-in at level 4 for suite bookings.  The breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails during our stay is very enjoyable.  Room is very clean with amenities that we needed for our stay. The only issue is the sofabed - not very comfortable and is a little squeaky. Haha.  Special mention to 2 staff at Straits Club, Lucy and Siti for the amazing customer service.  Lucy is my kids' favourite auntie. It was the first time my kids came to tell me how kind and wonderful a particular service crew has been and that person is Lucy. Lucy is very personalised, merticulous and approachable in her service. Her level of attentiveness is top notch - one of the best that i have ever seen. One of the examples of her great service: when my daughter's mask's loop broke, we were asking her to ask for a mask from the reception. Lucy who was clearing another table overheard our conservation, came over to offer to get her another new mask... Awww... ❤  Another service crew, Siti, is also commendable - she is very friendly and never fails to brighten our day with her smile and energy level.  Well done and keep up the wonderful work, Lucy and Siti!"
Best location to stay but not the service.,Date of stay: June 2022,40,you wont be able to feel be welcomed at this hotel as they are fully booked. The $200 credit they gave us to eat at the restaurant just for fun as we couldnt book at any restaurant. Finally they sent us to the Lantern rooftop bar for some nasty food. Not happy at all
Overall good experience except for dining reservation.,Date of stay: June 2022,40,"Stay was good overall except for dining reservation issue. Had wanted to make dinner reservations at Jade 3 weeks ahead of time, to celebrate a family birthday. Called, was told to go online, online said online booking not possible and to call instead. Called again only to be told Jade was not available during to a private function. Totally not customer-friendly. Dining reservations person was also very impatient. Hope this can be improved."
Complimentary Upgrade to Fullerton Suite,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Never in my life has my family experienced a staycation at a hotel room which comes with a large living room, a large bathroom and 2 large outdoor lounge areas. The toilet has a sensor-built in cover-lifting commode. The commode also comes complete with a remote control with special bidet functions. We really enjoyed our stay at the spacious suite. A big 'thank you' to the Fullerton Reception Staff for giving us a once-in-a-lifetime vacation!"
Local staycation,Date of stay: June 2022,40,"Check in was efficient, service staff were very polite and helpful. The room was well-furnished with many amenities, not to mention very hygienic. The view from the balcony, though not the best, really puts into perspective how close we were to the CBD."
Staycation,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Services by the staffs and cleanliness of the room was superb. A small little gesture tgat makes ny child happy: Free ice cream. Enjoyed our 3 days 2 nights staycation. This is my second visit of the year, looking forward to come back again."
Great hotel and location and history,Date of stay: June 2022,50,Great stay and very welcoming staff. The rooms were well maintained and easily accessible by lifts on both sides. Great variety of restaurants and michelin star restaurants also housed. We dined at Jade and had a great experience
ok,Date of stay: June 2022,30,"The building is beautiful and the location is perfect. Close to the Marina, Clarke Bay and many shops and restaurant. But the rooms at Fullerton are not as beautiful and and the Town Restaurant experience was not good at all. I was not too happy with the service at the hotel."
Service beyond excellent and great food,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"I would like to commend the Courtyard Team especially Mr Lalikumar and the other gentleman for their prompt and warm hospitality during my visit yesterday. Our requests of vegetarian and regular set is being met before we reached the place and our food were also served very fast. Top ups and 2nd helpings to refill were also initiated by Mr Lalikumar and team without prompting. It is indeed very impressive and we feel very welcome.  Sweets and savouries along with tea is free flow. For its price and quality, I feel it is a great value for money. I also feel it is a great idea to have a vegetarian set as I can enjoy the tea with my non vegetarian friends too!  We also had complimentary parking which is a nice gesture.  I recently had tea at other hotels around the area, and I have to commend that The Courtyard Afternoon tea is still the best. In this manpower shortage industry, I had observed the other hotels having the same no. servers to tables ratio but then they did not nail the customer experience as well as The Fullerton Hotel.  Good job team Fullerton Courtyard, we will be back! :)"
Better hotels fairly avaerage,Date of stay: June 2022,30,We Stayed here from 7-11 June had 3 rooms in the hotel. I think it is fair to say this hotel has cut down heavily due to covid had the exact same breakfast each and every day and the spread was also fairly average. My mother who is a vegetarian had the same breakfast every day for the 4 days we stayed in this hotel. Their so called Fullerton express service was bare basic and no one ever answered the call. The hotel has no late night room service and the in room dining menu is bare basic. We booked each room for SGD600+ per night these things are bare basic when you pay this kind of money. The hotel staff is also average not warm at all. I suggest you look at other hotels which will treat you better for the money you pay. Also if they are still keeping there prices up they should offer the full service not half of it.  We visit Singapore very often but this hotel is not worth it at all. Never staying here again
Home away from home,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"During my recent stay, The Fullerton was able to convince me almost completely. The experience began at the airport with a pre-booked private escort service at the airport and transfer in a state-of-the-art E200 Mercedes limousine. To my great delight, I was able to check into my room (Marina Bay View with access to The Straits Club) as early as 9:00 am and was generously given the opportunity for a second breakfast at ""The Straits Club"". So I could already use the arrival day for the main reason of my trip: Sightseeing. The room was located on the seventh floor and was equipped to the standards I had set for myself. A highlight was certainly the small balcony with a view of Marina Bay. Both for a coffee at sunrise or a sundowner with a view of the daily light show. Also convincing was the location with many sights within walking distance. For the more distant destinations, an MRT station virtually right outside the front door or a cab, which is much cheaper than in Germany, for example. My stay even more special made the times in The Straits Club for me. Formed it virtually a framework of tranquility and exclusivity, starting with an excellent breakfast (buffet and egg dishes to order), an Afternoon Tea with daily changing savory and sweet dishes (buffet) and a wide selection of TWG teas and the Evening Cocktail with changing canapés. The choice of different time slots allowed for individual adaptation to one's own daily routine. In any case, it was always nice to come ""home"" after an exciting day. I would like to especially emphasize Crystal, who not only does her job with full conviction and joy, but also had the time for an exchange about the experiences but also about new plans / tips for the coming day. This is the kind of service that stands out from the crowd and remains in memory. Finally, however, I also have a comment regarding potential for improvement, namely with regard to the concierge staff, whose standards have already been criticized in previous reviews. In my opinion, staff in this hotel category should greet the guest, especially if the guest does so of his own accord. Also, despite rush hour on Friday evening, it should be possible to give a certain level of manners when ordering a cab. It is not okay to point the finger at me and wordlessly show me any directional instructions with it. It is also not okay for the guest to transport his luggage to the cab himself and almost have to lift it into the cab himself. It should be remembered that the check-out process is the last moment of a guest and as such, of course, remains emphatically in the guest's memory."
Another Happy Stay,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"My family and I stayed in the Premier Collyer Suite for 2 nights from 8-10 June. We try to stay there every year as it was the place my wife and I were married in, and every year we are spoiled by the wonderful service and beautiful hotel.  This year, with the pandemic slowly easing up in Singapore, normal service is slowly resuming, and this meant a buffet spread at the Straits Club for Breakfast, Tea and Evening Canapes. This is something that you shouldn't miss if you get club access. We particularly enjoyed the Afternoon Tea, with the great selection of teas and the famous scones. The staff at the Club are attentive, caring and friendly, which really made a big difference this time around.  Though we did not get to use the amenities, the easing of the pandemic also meant that the different facilities (e.g. gym, pool) are now accessible without bookings, which is more convenient.  As for the room, the Premier Collyer Suite was spacious, and well maintained, and our room offered a really beautiful view of the Singapore River and the Central Business District of Singapore.  Location wise, the hotel is well located in the heart of the Central Business District, and is a unique architectural marvel, being a preserved national monument in the middle of an extremely modern part of town. It makes for a wonderful experience for both travellers and local staycationers alike."
terrible birthday staycation,Date of stay: June 2022,10,we were staying in room 502 and the mattress and topper trapped heat and make you sweat like mad in the middle of the night.....and the pillows were too soft that will make you suffer from stiff neck !

Staycation at Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: June 2022,40,"It was overall a good staying experience in Fullerton Hotel. However, experience in Jade was just normal.

Expect nothing less,Date of stay: June 2022,50,We had the room facing Marina Bay and the view was gorgeous. The hotel had a great buffet spread and is located conveniently to Raffles MRT Station. Only issue I find is the lack of food options on Sundays as it is also near CBD where food options are available Mon-Sat.
"Nice room, poor service",Date of stay: June 2022,20,"The hotel itself is nice, as is the room. The service of the staff was bad on multiple fronts. The breakfast buffet is really poor quality, so strongly recommend to have breakfast outside the hotel. The Jade restaurant for dinner was excellent and service there was great. But overall, I would not recommend this hotel for any trip other than a business trip, and even for business trip stay there are other hotels that off much better value/conven"

Enjoyable experience having pampered by the Fullerton Team!!,Date of stay: May 2022,50,"We booked for 2N in Palladium Suite for birthday celebration. The booking comes with Straits Club access. What impressed us most is not the room; we did not like it as it has 2 large mirrors facing the bed (geomacy reasons).

"Beautiful iconic hotel, excellent location, some quirks to be aware of",Date of stay: May 2022,50,"This is a truly spectacular property in the heart of Singapore. Everything is gorgeous from the lighting to the furniture to the bathroom fixures, and impeccable staff are everywhere you might need them. Best of all is the location which makes nearly every downtown trip walkable even in Singapore heat. I would just note that because this hotel is fitted to what was previously a post office, there are some design compromises, particularly in the rooms which are smaller than other Singapore hotels, and many rooms are interior facing to the vast lobby, thus receiving less natural light. The lifts are a bit slow as there aren't so many available. Again, these are inherant design contraints due to the building layout, they are not fatal flaws - just something to be aware of perhaps for couples traveling together on a longer trip who might want a slightly larger space."
Beautiful staycation,Date of stay: May 2022,40,Fabulous stay for my birthday. Club room was well worth it with the complimentary lounge. Pool is lovely and staff super nice. Room furniture is a little dated but bed super comfortable and quiet location.
Another excellent stay!having stayed here many times on my trips to S’pore I have never been disappointed.,Date of stay: May 2022,50,I have stayed at the Fullerton some 10 times over the years since it opened 20 years ago I believe. The helpful service as an example “Anais” a waitress in the Straits Club was thoughtful pleasant and super professional. French and Singaporian and proud of it. An example of the team that differentiates the hotel from many others. She shld be reconnûtes. And the Straits Club on the 4th floor is exceptional.
Enjoyable stay at The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Date of stay: May 2022,40,"Booked a room with a view of the quay pool. Good view, good room, and good vibes.

I would like to thank Sharon for coordinating and following up on my stays, as well as Rhea, Joshua Liu, Revathy and Warren for the warm hospitality shown across all my stays. Special mention to Joshua who always consistently followed up whenever there were issues raised.

Fullerton hotel is also serving a wonderful spread of dishes for buffet breakfast and it is certainly a highlight of our stay. The quality is also great and definitely a happy start to the day.

"Great hotel, but could improve in communicating with guests.",Date of stay: May 2022,30,"Wonderful stay at the Fullerton with great amenities, breakfast and location. It's within walking distance to many places with an underpass towards the Marina Bay area.  However, the hotel could have improved in its communication with guests about the construction noises during the day as it had interrupted our rest in room. We would have better planned our time in the hotel. We had expected more from a 5 star hotel with high end prices in this expect. Please inform your guests earlier regarding this, in order for them to make better decisions."
Sunday brunch at town restaurant,Date of stay: May 2022,50,"Ambience was nice & cozy. Window seats has lovely view of Andersen bridge & Victoria theatre. Great selection of seafood& hot food, fresh & tasty. Ordered the negroni, it was delicious. Dessert was surprisingly so wonderfully plated & yummy.Service staff Ms Princess was friendly & attentive. We will be back."
Fabulous location and amazing staff,Date of stay: April 2022,40,"I want to caveat that this would be a 5 star review but there were some minor things that made it jump to 4 which I'll detail below.  We had an amazing stay. The staff were all amazing and attentive which is a good thing. The kids were spoilt and treated like little princesses and of course they loved that.  Location: amazing. Raffles place MRT is just down the road and you can access so many areas of Singapore from there  Room: Small rooms but comfortable. We had the view of Marina Bay Sands and it was magical to sit there and watch the world go by from the balcony. Only issue with the rooms is that we had to request for a 4th towel twice (4 in the room) and they didn't replenish the toiletries for 2 days in a row so we had to call housekeeping to get it delivered. It was delivered by a guy who was on his phone and just stuck his hand out and walked away. I wouldn't make a big deal of this usually but when you are paying this much for accomodation, I also expect the service to match the price.  Food: The food didn't float my boat. So much so we went out for breakfast one morning. The staff will bring items on the menu from the buffet for hygiene reasons. On the first morning my hash browns were cold so they had been sitting in the food pod for a while. It didn't improve over the days so I would say this is one area that needs some attention. However, the cake store got a lot of our business and I have zero regrets over this.  Staff: Staff were super friendly and helpful. We are well aware of staffing shortages and training requirements but staff at the restaurant gave us different information to the staff at the reception, which differed to that from the concierge desk. Just some consistency would be good and the correct information too.  Pool: Pool was good and perfect to cool off in after hours of walking around.  Overall a super pleasant and luxurious stay for our first family trip to Singapore. I recommend this hotel if you would like to spoil yourself!"
Family of 20 loves Fullerton!,Date of stay: May 2022,50,"Fullerton hotel’s town restaurant had amazing customer service!!!

Not what we expect from Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: May 2022,30,"Not was we expect from fullerton hotel with a good reputation, front desk staff is not helpful, bad mood, and not friendly. Breakfast is cold n doesnt taste good although it is ‘ordered from the menu’. Car park is a long walk."
Excellent rooms and facilities,Date of stay: April 2022,40,We enjoyed our stay in the heritage rooms with spacious balconies. The housekeeping staff was very good despite the hotel being nearly full. The breakfast is very good as well except the staff serving can sometimes appear disinterested (hence the 4 star rating and not 5)
Mediocre,Date of stay: May 2022,30,"Perhaps it was because we visited during the labour day holiday, but check-in was delayed by 2.5 hrs and there was no clear communication, so we spent a lot of time waiting. Breakfast was average, pool was really small, and all in all we expected more from a 5 star hotel.  Room was nice though, and it was clean."

We had a very pleasant & memorable time there. Thank you for the very warm and thoughtful service. We will surely like to visit again!"
Quayside Pool Room Review,Date of stay: May 2022,50,I requested the middle room to the pool view and it was well noted by the hotel. View was great. Was surprised by a bottle of bubbles non alcoholic. Room was clean and neat and luxurious. The portable stereo sound system was clear and enjoyed jazz music throughout .I think the people at the pool enjoyed it too there were a few thumbs up! Great experience. In room dining was delicious. Recommend the lobster nasi lemak!
Outstanding service and quality,Date of stay: May 2022,50,"Location and service cannot be beaten. The property has so much history and the free one our tour is very recommended. The staff (absolutely everyone) goes beyond expectation to make you feel welcome and provide their very best. The place is spotless everywhere. The amenities are fantastic. If you want a very special and memorable stay... this is it. The cake shop is wow! In room dining was very nice. Coffees on the expensive side, but overall... truly wonderful."
Comfortable stay at nice room,Date of stay: April 2022,40,Really nice stay and good services over all. They managed to deal with my early checkin and late check out requests. Every staffs are kind and helpful except a restaurant. It would be great if they would improve restaurant menus and services more.
Honeymoon upgrade,Date of stay: May 2022,50,"Lovely hotel as expected, very well designed. We were upgraded to a suite instead of the balcony with Marina Bay view we booked which was so so spacious and nice. There was a slice of welcome mud cake waiting for us in the room. Location is superb. Sadly we were only in Singapore for 3 days. Will definitely come back!"
Wonderful Fullerton hotel staycation,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Overall, we had a great experience staying at Fullerton hotel. The room was wonderful and clean, the amenities were great. I would definitely recommend this outstanding hotel to my friends and family ;P"
2 day stay at Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: May 2022,50,"Very nice and good location Hotel. Staff are friendly and pleasant. Approachable and helpful. Th hotel is well maintained and very comfortable and beautiful rooms. Very easy to get around and about, via bus, trains, taxi and walk abound. Right in the heart of the city."
Spacious room and cosy ambience,Date of stay: May 2022,40,"It was a good stay for our anniversary overall with the good level of hospitality standard from the staff. However, the stay was slightly tainted by an isolated incident whereby the bathing towels were not clean. The towels had pubic hairs stuck to them. Perhaps the hotel could look into the laundry segment."
Book by the rating. Big mistake. Go MBS instead,Date of stay: April 2022,10,Just don't do it. You will regret. This hotel is a joke. Def a three star hotel. Go MBS you will see the difference. Breakfast was horrifying. No wonder the restaurants inside is empty and the lounge bar is empty
Enjoyable Stay...Manage to have a good rest.,Date of stay: May 2022,50,My friend and I have a good rest and we are delighted by the 1for 1 promo over the labour Day Hari Raya Long weekend. Great deal. We take the opportunity to visit and eat the nearby restaurants and food centre.
A lackluster experience,Date of stay: May 2022,30,"service staff found wanting, quality of food disappointing, quality of accommodation good, however the layout of the hotel is confusing and many times i had to ask for directions, being accompanied by my aged mum who is wheel-chair bound, i found it tricky to navigate the open spaces and noticed that there is absolutely no markers to indicate when the flooring gives way to steps, no gradient of color to distinguish a drop which presents a serious trip hazard for anyone especially the less mobile, was not able to find the swimming pool deck as the lifts we took were not the right ones, so ended up going around in a maze, lastly my daughter was unable to use the spa facilities even though it was still early enough as she was informed they were closing."
Very comfortable stay!,Date of stay: April 2022,50,had a very nice and comfortable stay! The location is fabulous and so are the views and proximity to all key areas in the CBD. Rooms are just the right size and nicely equipped with all modern facilities. Breakfast experience was great though the place was totally deserted in evenings as guests were hardly seen at the F&B outlets. Staff is very polite and courteous too.
Great location and facilities,Date of stay: May 2022,50,Last few weeks travelling mostly for a holiday but in part business. This Hotel is very well located and services provided are exceeding good. I intend to return to Singapore and will book again to stay at this Hotel
Lousiest Check in experiece,Date of stay: April 2022,30,"Chaotic, messy and very slow check in. The staff were not attentive. All avoid eye contact. Like visiting A&E department of public hospital. By the way, it was during a long May day weekend. But a good glass hotel should still perform much better than this."
Best Birthday,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"As always the Guest Services team is impeccable - I really appreciate how they try to remember you name,.  It was my birthday so they gave me a cake and it was delicious.  The room was beautiful and i love the bathrooms"
Memorable stay,Date of stay: May 2022,50,We had spent our long weekend at the fullerton hotel and were delighted with the guest services as well as the suite that we stayed in. It offers a great view of the MBS and the city skyline. Special thanks to straits club staffs Lucy and Nicholas who were very attentive and friendly. Thanks again for leaving memorable experience for ny family.
Great Hotel,Date of stay: May 2022,50,"This hotel is centrally located for easy access to all that Singapore has to offer. Easy access to rail system, and walking/dining areas. I would definitely choose this hotel again if I return. Great friendly staff that are willing to meet your needs."
Fantastic stay at Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: April 2022,40,"My first time experiencing a staycation at The Fullerton, the stay was near perfect, enjoyed an afternoon tea at The Courtyard and a sumptuous dinner at The Town with friends. The quality of the food was good, whilst we can understand they were short-handed with service crew, appreciate the team was working hard to keep the service level up. Breakfast at The Town in the morning sitting outside at the terrace was the best setting overlooking the Andersen bridge and Singapore River. On the other hand, the service was first class and the breakfast choice was also good, a mixture of oriental and western options."
Delightful oasis in downtown Singapore,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"A splendid and memorable experience, elevated by great details in terms of property and in room experience. Would happily return either on biz or with family. Breakfast area and quality were good, the public spaces are large and expansive, and the whisky bar was a fun end of night treat on one eve! Thanks to all the helpful and attentive staff"
Stay in The Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: May 2022,40,"Overall quite satisfied with the stay except for the check-in. Delayed of slightly more than an hour after check-in before we were given the keys to our room. However, given the stay was during long public holiday, could expect the crowd but thought the management could have better managed it."
"Great location, well maintained",Date of stay: May 2022,40,"The rooms were clean, the location is central, check in was well organised and smooth even though it was a long weekend with many families. The pool is not big but good enough to have fun with great view of Boat Quay"
One night at The Fullerton,Date of stay: May 2022,50,"My wife and I spent only an overnight staycation at the Fullerton, without setting up any sort of expectations. The outcome only served to whet our appetite for more opportunities here and certainly what we experienced went beyond what we would have imagined - attention to details in the room and at the lounge, kind and welcoming front desk experience and check-in from the Straits club lounge and the warm hospitality of our hosts - Crystal and June - made the whole 24 hours worth its while! Good job, Fullerton!"
One night in Fullerton,Date of stay: May 2022,50,"Overall good. Not recommended for food, town Restaurent was decent but the breakfast was not as expected. One the options were very limited and the quality was not up to the mark. Like we expected fresh juice and tetra pack was served"
Wonderful Birthday week,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Had a wonderful week in Singapore. Overall stay was wonderful-the room was clean and well-maintained, friendly and helpful staff, service was superb. Great location with great view. Will definitely stay again!"
Good environment and good customer service,Date of stay: April 2022,40,The hotel staffs are friendly and they are always there to assist the guest even though they are busy with high volume of guests checking in. The location of the hotel is very convenient to travel around and have a nice surrounding where you can take a walk after dinner to relax and take photos
Singapore Heritage,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"A building that sees Singapore grows from British colonies to independent. With the book and a corner at L1, we can learn a lot of history which we the younger generation didn’t know. Thumbs up for the effort. It an educational and reminiscing trip to rediscover Singapore. Really love the stay and the bathroom. My hubby especially enjoyed the toilet bowl which have disinfect purposes."
Beyond expectation,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"We are hesitant to stay at high end properties as we have found that the experience does not always match the hype, however, this is definitely not the case with The Fullerton. From the moment of arrival until checkout, our stay was simply fantastic. The Fullerton is well above our pay grade but it was a birthday treat and we managed to get an exceptional rate for a courtyard room which was spacious, very comfortable and quiet. We stayed for four nights of a 9 night trip to Singapore and after day one we were eagerly trying to change our stay to the entire 9 nights but sadly that was not possible. The complimentary history tours the hotel provides were terrific as were the guides, Linda and Thomas. The pool area was a lovely sanctuary and Selikan was a gracious host, All pre arrival enquiries were answered promptly by the Concierge team. We look forward to returning to The Fullerton on our next trip to Singapore."
The Fullerton! High expectations and they deliver!,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"The family and I had a great experience during our staycation with the Fullerton hotel because of the friendly service we received throughout our 3 day stay! Special mention for the pool guy who always greeted everyone with a smile and ever helpful. Also special mention for Ms. Rhea, who helped us check out and made the experience pleasant and friendly.👏🙏"
Palladian Suite - with the best view!,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"I came with my family and we loved our stay at the Fullerton. The service, the staff, the room, the view, everything.  Thank you once again to the staff that helped us checkin and Strait Club staff members who assisted us whenever we went for breakfast, tea or canpes."
Amazing experience,Date of stay: April 2022,50,All the staff were incredibly helpful and went above and beyond. The location is good with a beautiful pool overlooking Singapore river. The room was clean and well kept with fantastic amenities. I would recommend staying here.
Not perfect,Date of stay: April 2022,30,"Good architecture, the check-in process is a nightmare. I requested for early check-in, but I understand that this request is based on room availability. However, I got the room way beyond the stated timing.."
"Bad Reservation Team, Marina Room View = Wall Facing",Date of stay: April 2022,10,"Bad reservation team who does not read email. Informed them that i did not received my booking confirmation and I had checked my junk mail and there is nothing there. Their reply : Did you check your junk mail? :(  I requested for a pool facing room and was told fully taken. The check-in staff is so nice to offer me an upgrade of $X with a marina view, In the end Marina View = Wall facing view. Deposit for room was also charge twice to my credit card with one is doubled of what should be collected."
Town Restaurant Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"The whole experience was superb and the service was all excellent. A big thanks to Ms Princess and Sir Rey for granting requests. Aside from the great service, we especially liked the Miso-marinated Salmon. The sweets are a special recommendation to all who has a sweet tooth like me. Thanks Town Restaurant! Will surely come back and recommend to all friends 😉"
Town Restaurant Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"A buffet for the first time after lifting the restrictions. Very nice service esp from the staff Princess & Rey. Though we were still need to ask the staff for the food, we'll be back again next time."
"Very good, but not excellent …..",Date of stay: April 2022,40,"Have always wanted to stay at this iconic hotel and thought what better place than this historic heritage to bring my almost-80-year-old parents and in-laws on their very first staycation. Booking was seamless and Mira was extremely patient and helpful with her excellent suggestion of esplanade rooms facing the Marina Bay. Check-in was really smooth with Tomoko. We were indeed impressed with the spacious and well appointed esplanade rooms which were very clean and well maintained; and our housekeeper did a great job everyday. But daily breakfast, which was included in our room rate, was sorely disappointing as it seemed like the hotel/restaurant was just intent on getting the job done with minimum effort; both in terms of menu variety and service. The concierge team was not proactive, in fact almost disinterested. All in, a good stay but suggest the hotel management look into the daily operations of the Town Restaurant."
"Great wedding dinner, super nice rooms and service",Date of stay: April 2022,50,"very clean and atas hotel, we came here to host our wedding dinner in the straits room and it was great, Violette, our wedding manager handled our wedding very well. We stayed in the Fullerton Suite and it was SUPER MAGNIFICENT I LOVE IT super recommend, the landing point high tea was great too the food is nice thank you fullerton"
Puzzling Service,Date of stay: April 2022,40,"This is a top-notch hotel, beautiful building, great rooms. But the service is far from top-notch. The bin in my room was not emptied, twice. The amenities in the bathroom were not replaced. Orders at breakfast were only partially fulfilled. This is puzzling for a hotel as well-regarded (and expensive) as the Fullerton."
Birthday Staycation,Date of stay: April 2022,40,============================ Pleasant stay experience. Service was good and food were great as well. Kiddos enjoyed the hotel facilities. Would visit again if there is a promotion for family package. =============================
55th Birthday Celebration,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"We went to the Fullerton Hotel for a staycation to celebrate my 55th Birthday. The staff were very kind and offered us very good service, from the time we checked in, had our meals and checked out the next day, every staff we met were friendly and helpful. They really made us feel so welcomed."
Facilities in room not fuction well,Date of stay: April 2022,30,"A bit disappointed due to fridge not working in my room. Called technician to check but he say need to wait one hour to monitor, the fridge will only turn on while we check in. We waiting whole night the conditions still same. I brought a cheese cake to celebrate my wife birthday, surprise unable to use the fridge to keep the birthday day cake. It make my day gone..we only can keep the cake at reception area.  Rain shower mixer also a bit leakage while using. Bad experience to bring my wife here to celebrate our anniversary."
Amazing location and even better facilities,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"The hotel has a great location. All the important places are at a walking distance from the hotel - Merlion Park, MBS, Museum, Cavenagh Bridge is right outside the lobby. Our stay was comfortable. Thanks Fullerton."
"Superb service, great experience",Date of stay: April 2022,50,"It was a wonderful 3D2N stay for us. Staff was friendly and attentive, hotel breakfast was amazing and the hotel location is in close proximity to many local attractions. It is right opposite the Asian Civilization Museum!"
Palladian suite birthday celebration,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Incredible Palladian suite at The Fullerton Singapore. It was a easy check in and I had the suite facing Singapore River. It was breath-taking with amazng blacony views. Many thanks to Rhea and reservations/frontdesk team for arranging my birthday amentities too.  I also enjoyed myself at The Straits Club for afternoon tea and evening canape. The lounge also serves made-to-order breakfast and they have delicious eggs dishes. I am right to choose The Fullerton Singapore as my birthday celebration.  In a month’s time, I am heading back to Fullerton for another birthday celebration and also try out the other Palladian suite. It is always a joy to see Robby and Lizzy soon."
Truly relaxing and pampering stay,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Top notch right from the aesthetics, reception, room, facilities and staff friendliness/attentiveness. Truly enjoyed our stay there with the enjoyable facilities and rich history of the hotel. Venturing out of the hotel is also a breeze with many local attractions nearby."
Reception staff was unfriendly and unhelpful,Date of stay: April 2022,30,"Counter staff wasn’t helpful at all. We asked about the upgrade to heritage room (stated in the voucher) and she said it’s subject to availability. Next moment she didn’t even check for us and just checked us in to the courtyard room. We asked again and she simply said not available. But when I checked online there were still many heritage rooms available. We asked for parking coupon and she said “you can only exit once, subsequently it’s payable”. She seems so unfriendly and unhelpful, totally ruined our experience from the start. Buffet area was also severely understaffed though they’re friendly and nice"
Short Family Trip,Date of stay: April 2022,50,The Fullerton Hotel is excellent as ever. Beautiful architecture and luxurious feel and stay. Comfortable and in room amenities such as the bluetooth speaker and the chromecast feature of the TV is very much appreciated since we had kids with us. Would definitely stay again in the future.
My stay at Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: April 2022,50,Did a staycation at Fullerton Hotel for my anniversary. Amazingly friendly service by all members of the hotel staff. Check in process was simple and quick. Breakfast was amazing and swimming was fun.
My Birthday staycation,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"I have a wonderful staycation, and unforgetable moments with my family.This is our 1st time to stay in this Hotel and I did not regret to choose this. I would like to commend Anne Hakqim . Senior Guest officer for her outstanding service . She is an asset. Also the chinese young lady who is assigned to clean our room , she did very good job . Indeed my family had a pleasant and great stay from day 1 till our last day of stay . Will definately come back again"
Luxury hotel which spares no expenses…perfect stay,Date of stay: April 2022,50,We stayed at the Fullerton’s hotel for 2 nights. They had a staycation deal at the time - 2 nights for the price of 2 so ended up being really good value by Singapore standards.  Location- Great location as it’s right next to the Marina Bay.  Room- I love the room decor. It had the biggest tv ever. The bathroom had one of those smart toilets that does everything for you - all you need to do is sit. Haha.  Service - customer service was great and very responsive.  We didn’t have breakfast here so can’t comment on food.  Would recommend and stay again if I’m Singapore.
Fantastic hotel. Highly recommend.,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Fantastic hotel. We will definitely be staying there next time we visit Singapore. The staff were so helpful and a friendly and accommodating. Beautiful hotel, very clean, classy and an excellent location."
Overpriced and Terrible Service,Date of stay: April 2022,10,"Very disappointed at this hotel. I want a family package for a connected Heritage room $450 per night to stay 2 nights, but at check out, hotel charged me 2 rooms 2 nights for $1800! During the booking and my stay, hotel didn't explained to me the connected room is a 2 room 2 fees, insisted I stayed 2 rooms and must pay 2 room prices. The staff Ms. Rhea was very unprofessional and not friendly at all, keep on saying it's their policy and I have signed the papers... Even I complained to the director of rooms, Mr Terry Wu still said the they had sent me confirmations and they are nothing wrong with it. The problem is this hotel just want to rip off you and doesn't care the customers. They don't care customer feeling at all. This hotel didn't explain to customers their services well and charges customers every penny of it. Look at what this hotel offers: hotel room line always no answer; no one take orders and clean the tables in the restaurants, doesn't clean rubbish bin for room cleaning. staffs are unhelpful. Doesn't worth it at all."
Great stopover,Date of stay: April 2022,50,Have always loved the Fullerton and it didnt disappoint when our family stopped over for 2 nights on route from Sydney to London. We look forward to returning soon .... might even try the Fullerton Bay!
Amazing stay!,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Kudos to front desk staff, Anne for a smooth & quick check-in process. Requested for early check in and room was already ready! A birthday cake is also sent to my room after awhile. Pleasant stay & all staffs are welcoming as well. Can’t wait to be back!"
A Singapore Grand Dame,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"We have stayed here more than 10 times and would never visit Singapore and not stay here. As soon as we step in and smell the grand lobby area, it feels like home. The staff are always attentive, friendly but unintrusive. Rooms classy, clean with the most comfortable beds. We love the Fullerton and Fullerton Bay."
"Very grand hotel, great staff",Date of stay: April 2022,40,"Really enjoyed my stay at The Fullterton - the bed was very comfortable, room service and housekeeping was very good, the gym, pool and sauna were all excellent, and the bathtub was a treat! The only reason for giving 4 stars rather than 5 is that I found the breakfast options a bit limited and I couldn't really get the sort of breakfast I'd like to have."
Truly a wonderful experience,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"This is the best hotel we have stayed in Singapore for the past two years. Checking in/out is fuss free, the decorations are pleasing to look at and the room we stayed in is clean and comfortable. It is also located in a good location, with Raffles MRT station a stone's throw away. Even though there's no halal food provided by the hotel, we can easily get them from nearby places like Lau Pa Sat, Esplanade and Marina Square, just to name a few. If you are someone who wants to experience a staycation here at least once, I highly recommend you to do so. No regrets from my wife and I. Thank you Fullerton for our pleasant stay :)"
Wonderful experience!,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Our first time staying here and we had a wonderful stay. I will say the service we experienced was incredible good, thank you for the hotel team. The location is absolutely stunning and the view from the lobby is certainly an amazing welcome. The room was impeccable cleaned. Amazing welcoming at the club. The breakfast was simply fantastic. Thank you Nicholas and the team went out of their way to make sure that my family had a great stay. We had a peaceful and relaxing stay. Will definitely come back for our next staycation."
Excellent Service,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"We went for a short staycation at the Fullerton hotel and was truly satisfied with the service of the hotel, from pre-arrival check-in, registration, room service and the restaurant service! Everyone of the staff were attentive, courteous, friendly and efficient in the service they rendered! Rey, who was in the Town restaurant was also extraordinary and provided excellent service! We will surely be back to experience more the Fullerton hotel next time."
Classic beauty,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Full of historical beauty and in a location with enthralling skyline. With so many other luxury hotels competing in the same space, Fullerton continues to stand tall with her own uniqueness and is a classic that withstands the test of time,"
Staycation at Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: April 2022,50,Definitely worth the money. Luxurious amenities in the room and facilities. All the staff were friendy and helpful. Stayed at Quay room facing the Singapore River and boat Quay. My only wish is for a bigger pool area. Overall we has a very relaxing staycation. Will definitely come back.
Central to Everything,Date of stay: April 2022,40,Great Hotel. Family trip made easy with close access to great food and attractions. Service is very good but the food quality could be better and customer service needs more effort especially when seeking a snack or a coffee. But the room and guest services are excellent. You are close to many great eateries within 5 minute walks.
Pleasant stay in historic quarter,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"Liked the friendly staff, outdoor breakfast/dining option and central location. Rooms were very big, but a bit barren. Pool became quite full quickly. Was very convenient for home learning and working."
quick renovation staycation,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"excellent service, room and warm attentive staff. I would highly recommend this hotel in Singapore among the myriad of choices around. Location is also fantastic with attractions nearby and very well connected to the subway (MRT) lines. One of the best price/value offerings at the high level"
My First Fullerton Experience,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"I got the opportunity to stay at the Fullerton Singapore thanks to an AMEX promotion. Despite that, I felt that the staff still gave their 100% in providing me the best possible service. The front office staff was so friendly and even gave us directions on which way will be the best to go up to our room and reassured us about the quality of the room without us even asking. In room dining staff was also very friendly and sent our request up promptly.  The room was also extremely big and I enjoyed the bathtub inside the room. The best thing about the room would have to be the toilet bowl as it has a seat warmer and it makes the experience enjoyable.  Thank you Fullerton Hotel"
Great quality hotel,Date of stay: April 2022,50,One of the great quality hotel in Singapore. The amenity in the room and bed was the best in me. I would like to stay this hotel again and extend my experience in Singapore again! Thank you for your kind service and great care.
Absolutely love this hotel,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"My daughter and I absolutely enjoyed our stay at this grand old dame. The Fullerton Hotel smacks of luxury, history and elegance, from the moment we walked in.  So glad that I picked this hotel for our short stay in Singapore. We would happily stay here again.  What makes our visit here so memorable are the hotel staff that we met. Staff members such as Crystal, Siti, Joshua (at reservation), Rhea, Gallen, Sep, and pool attendants. They are so friendly and they still maintain professionalism in carrying out their tasks of making sure visitors feel at home and at ease during their stay.  We booked our hotel through Qantas and I must say that Qantas has had rather stuff up our booking. However, thanks to Joshua and his colleagues, checking in went rather smoothly in spite of the misplaced booking.  After checkin, Joshua took us to the club room to enjoy much needed cocktails and canapés."
Good but starting to date,Date of stay: April 2022,40,"Beautiful public areas and great location.  Room we had was Marina Bay view room - lovely outlook.  Rooms a touch too small and decor a bit tired - sheers tatty, bathroom taps and sinks didn't work properly.  Food choices old fashioned and boring (but some restaurants not ipen / available).  Pool lovely.but small for number of people"
20220410-20220416,Date of stay: April 2022,40,"Over all great and luxurious experience. Swimming pool, location, concierge service are great. What can be better is to increase the flexibility in terms of portion to reduce food loss. The sewer may be old and there is smell from time to time in the room."
Fullerton Hotel Staycation,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"I emailed in requesting for early check-in, and was granted that at 11am! Great service provided by front desk who explained everything to us and made the whole process smooth and easy. The room was big and spacious, and had alot of natural light from the window. We enjoyed the pool facilities, and the view from the pool. The in-room dining food was delicious! Definitely going back for that again. Overall, we had an enjoyable time, and would love to return to The Fullerton Hotel again soon."
Lovely ambience for staycation and afternoon tea,Date of stay: February 2022,50,We really enjoyed ourselves at the Fullerton hotel during our staycation. Check in was done smoothly and smiles from all staff. They even guided us to our rooms. The room was cosy and had a spectacular view of the bay area.. lovely to just hang out in the room the entire day and enjoy this! We had afternoon tea at the Courtyard and the spread was delicious and so much variety. Not to mention each item was delicately made.. we could not even bear to eat it and took many photos... The ambience and atmosphere at the Courtyard was quiet and relaxing. The staff were also again attentive and would replenish our food whenever they saw it was empty. Had an enjoyable time! We would always return for a staycation and Fullerton is always the first choice!
Great Staycation - with room for improvement!,Date of stay: April 2022,40,"We had the Palladian Suite with a tent set up for our 4yo with a night sky projector and she looooved it. The room is great - well decorated, very clean, very comfortable and luxurious. Toilet is impressive. Excellent view of the harbour, the Flyer and Marina Bay Sands. Shame there was no private balcony - think that would be for rooms facing the CBD side. I'm nitpicking here - the breakfast at the Straits Club can be better as some food items were not very impressive. And they should have a kid's room somewhere in the hotel - a place for kids to play while mummy and daddy can relax and enjoy the staycation."
Pleasant Staycation,Date of stay: April 2022,50,Stayed 1 night with family. There was a queue to check-in but staff organized us neatly and invited us to have a seat while waiting. Took about 30 mins. Gym was clean. Great location. Room service was prompt. Had high expectations and glad to say they were met.
April Stay,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Perfect from check in to checkout. Large room with child’s cot. Very nice bathroom set up. Clean and comfortable. Pillows a little soft, but that’s really being pedantic. Very good value for money too for a 5* hotel!"
Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Celebrated my husband’s birthday with a staycation at Fullerton Hotel. We had a toddler with us. Service was superb - from front desk to dining to room. Location was great, we love that many places are within walkable distance. We enjoyed the stay!"
A really great pleasure to be at Fullerton Hotel in SG,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Very comfortable and luxurious Hotel, really nice breakfast, the whole atmosphere is really great and the staff is so courteous and friendly.

Overall comfortable stay,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Hotel staff were very friendly and approachable:) Location of hotel is convenient to CBD area, nearest mrt is Raffles place. There are convenient stores that are within 10mins walk from hotel. Overall, good environment."
Great experience,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Great Place, Great Hotel, Great Room, Great Check-in/Check-out, & Great Staff. I was satisfied with all the service and hotel facilities. Swimming pool was also very nice. I want to stay this hotel again."

Great stay for anniversary celebration,Date of stay: April 2022,50,Friendly and helpful staffs. Comfy bed and spacious bathtub. Some issues regarding the small faults in the room but otherwise the entire experience was great and relaxing for me and my bf. Highly recommended for couples!
They only accept calls. No SMS or WhatsApp,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Was able to snag a 50% promo for a 2 night stay. Absolute steal and must for at least once in your life. Service was impeccable. Was disappointed front desk insisted on calls. No SMS or WhatsApp... perhaps a guest conscious about roaming charges isn't their target market? Also the location is between MRT stations (about 1/3rd to Raffles Place and 2/3rds to City Hall) and bus stops are quite a walk (like 800m) so location can be a bother if your meetings are not in the business district... which is also dead on weekends, so taxis can be hard to come by."
A truly memorable experience,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"The team at The Fullerton were so friendly, service was exceptional and they truly made sure I felt at home. They were hospitable, always up for a nice chat, gave me fantastic tips and the personal touches were all noticed and appreciated. The location is fantastic, I will be returning and recommending to others too. It was extremely welcoming the whole time."
this is called Hotel,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"very good location, near to Marina Bay Sand, Clarck Quay, theater, MRT etc Location is good for running, walking, riding in the morning room is big, clean and service is excellent from front liner, Restaurant inside hotel is quality one"
Fabulous hotel and go back again,Date of stay: April 2022,40,"I have stayed in both Fullerton by the Bay and The Fullerton. I like the Fullerton by the Bay room as the furniture and finishing is of great quality but too cozy (is dark). Whereas The Fullerton Hotel we have a great room - Marina Bay View room, good view, staying in room 601 but the toilet needs some upkeep. Should try the spa at The Fullerton Hotel, staff and therapist are very professional."
1 Day Trip @ Fullerton,Date of stay: April 2022,50,Overall I'm very happy with the stay in Fullerton. All the staff is very friendly and helpful. The room is very nice and spacious. I'm amazed with the automatic open/close toilet seat. Fullerton will be in my list for my future staycation!
Hotel apt for only one-night stay,Date of stay: March 2022,20,Room cleaning after one night would not be properly done. Breakfast staffs might ask your name every morning. Might be noisy to work in the room. Staff might neglect you and give you a spare room instead
Limited options for vegetarians,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"We were on a staycation. It was an awesome experience. Room was nice and cozyand the service was standard . The only blip in our experience were 1) leaky shower , not a big deal for us, not sure it is for a 5 star Property  2) limited vegetarian options for breakfast.  But a great staycation nevertheless"
Disappointed,Date of stay: April 2022,40,"Fell short of my expectations. We booked the palladian suite, room looked nice but bedding was too soft. Though room had a purifier, we could feel it was dusty and I developed rashes due to the dust. Breakfast at straits club was disappointing, and spa was not worth it."
Enjoyable stay,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Overall it was a great experience, considering the price that we got at a discount (it was a steal!) The only thing that the room didnt have was a view, else everything was good! Even the toilet was awesome - warm toilet bowl that many other hotels do not provide."
"Great Experience, amazing room and service",Date of stay: April 2022,50,First time at The Fullerton hotel and safe to say I will be going back there in the future!  I really enjoyed the stay and the service staff were very helpful and patient with us. Definitely recommend for those who want a really luxurious experience.
Luxury,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"An idyllic retreat. From the minute we walked in, we knew we were going to have the best vacation. The formal ball rooms and pool side is just exquisite not to mention the restaurants and views. The location is also just stunning"
Ok Stay,Date of stay: March 2022,40,I had a good stay overall here.  The Marina Bay View room was comfortable and quite well maintained.  The hotel seemed to still be limited in its offerings. The in-room dining choices were limited and breakfast had a limited menu.  Overall it may be necessary to give an opinion after the hotel sector in Singapore fully re-opens.
3D2N stay,Date of stay: March 2022,50,We love everything from service to the room aesthetics. We tried the glamping package and the kids were thrilled to be able to sleep in their sleeping bags! The service staffs would remember us even if its our second visit only. Very impressive!
A Stay with Fullerton,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"Overall service and room environment is great, breakfast is nice as well. the only thing can improve is the sleeping pillow, because it is too soft that easily be flattened the longer you lie down. Other than that, all the staffs there, including housekeeping person are all very friendly."
Appreciation of the Fullerton Heritage Hotel,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"Top Marks to the Fullerton Hotel which made my more than one month stay in Singapore memorable, enjoyable and very pleasant. The staff and team under the expert leadership of GM Gino Tan are extremely excellent and the food scene under new Culinary Director David Laval are moving the bar up and up! I would definitely recommend the Fullerton and would stay here again and again!"
"Amazing Hotel, Top Service",Date of stay: March 2022,50,"Best stay I had among the other local hotels I've been to. It was very spacious, very peaceful and service was great! Everything in the hotel was very updated, we could even chrome cast our own Netflix and Disney Plus.I will definitely come back again in the future."
Great hotel for staycation.,Date of stay: April 2022,50,Had great staycation experience with family.. gotten 2 rooms and the hotel provides the connecting rooms that makes the stay more enjoyable! Staff prepare little surprise for my belated birthday… greatly appreciated..
Family Stay Cation,Date of stay: April 2022,50,"2 nights spent.location was great with lots of place of interest,food,live bands n shopping malls.A great place for tourists and even locals.Our Marina Bay View Room was awesome!The room is spacious as well.."
The Fullerton is a must!,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"The Fullerton Hotel is a wonderful stay in Singapore. The history and charm of the building along with its central location made it one of our top picks! While we didn’t get a view, we had a patio and the room was huge, clean and very comfortable. All the staff where friendly and helpful. We dined at Town for lunch on the terrace, the food was amazing. We also dined at Jade and the Peking Duck was the best I have ever eaten! The pool is great and over looks the river and park beyond, just watch the tiles though, they are a bit slippery. Overall this is an exceptional Hote and we will definitely be back!"
Clean and Nice,Date of stay: March 2022,50,The room was well maintained and clean. I like that the under bed is sealed so that my son’s toys have no chance to slip under the bed when he play. The interior of the bathtub is clean and no rust as well. Overall nice experience!
They don't want customers back...,Date of stay: March 2022,10,Overall service fully still in covid peek quality or lack of. No room cleaning after noon even if you leave the relevant button pressed. Tried to book a meeting room and had to attempt 3 times for a total of almost 90 minutes of wait: only thing that is gone back to pre covid are prices... actually those are even higher.
One Night Staycation by AMEX,Date of stay: April 2022,40,"Free one night stay in the Premiere Courtyard room. The staff ascertained that we would be using the pool facilities during check-in, therefore, he placed us on the same floor (Second floor) as the pool! That gives us much convenience to access the pool! Had dinner else where as there are plenty of food options in the immediate vicinity within walking distance. Breakfast was @ the Town Restaurant. The standard English Breakfast and choices of how the egg are done. The Nasi Lemak and Laksa are great but not spicy. Too much rice for the Nasi Lemak.  Overall a great short getaway from home."
Cleanliness,Date of stay: March 2022,50,The cleanliness of the hotel was superb. The room was clean. Neatly organised.The view from my room was nice. What could be improved is that for the window to be slightly bigger than now. Other than that i had an enjoyable trip !
Great customer service,Date of stay: March 2022,40,"Stay in a Marina Bay View room, view was good and the customer services is excellent. The only down side is if you intend to travel in the late hours, the basement door to the carpark is lock, have to walk abit further to go to the carpark."
Classic Hotel,Date of stay: March 2022,40,Overall feelings good only the bed too soft and able to sleep well as hard to turn my body. The toilet and bathtub is good and clean. Staffs are very polite and helpful. Restaurant food reasonable especially Jade.
Staycation,Date of stay: March 2022,40,Staff were helpful and friendly. Check in was ok as there was some delay. The room is big however the windows were blocked by some structure. Hence limited view towards the singapore river.(not sure why got a structure). Overall stay was ok.
Favourite hotel!,Date of stay: March 2022,50,The renovated rooms were lovely! Toilet comes with heated seats and bidet. All the hotel staff were pleasant and even greeted us along the corridors too. Pool and gym were great too! Would definitely come back again.
not impressed,Date of stay: March 2022,30,"i expected the service to be better for a hotel of this stature. beautiful hotel, beautiful room, beautiful facilities but very, very disappointing service! first impression at the entrance was not very welcoming either. The concierge section definitely needs improvement!"
"Great room service, ambience",Date of stay: March 2022,50,"Had a pleasant stay at the Fullerton hotel from 28-30 march 2022 at room 240. Was most impressed by Simon, whose professionalism and hospitality shown during room service is very commendable, and certainly made the stay more remarkable."
Pleasant and cosy stay,Date of stay: March 2022,40,"Loved the bathtub (mirror) and the biggest TV I've ever seen in a hotel room (50""). Downside was there was virtually no view; the occasional hammering & drilling and lipstick mark on the coffee cup did not help either."
Truly deserving,Date of stay: March 2022,50,It’s been awhile since we were attended to with such great service and professionalism. The view of the marina bay from our suite was amazing and the infinity pool was also the perfect way to end our staycation. Will definitelt want to come back and stay again!!
The Courtyard,Date of stay: March 2022,50,Came here to have a high tea session with my mum on her birthday. Was warmly welcomed by friendly staff and manager. The manager (Lalikumar) was super friendly to us and very attentive to our needs. Will definitely visit The Courtyard again and recommend tonour friends and family.
Suite room is disappointing,Date of stay: March 2022,30,"We booked a Suite room, given we have a newborn and toddler, hence would require a bigger room. However the exprience of staying in a Suite room does not make any difference except for lounge access and a bigger room size. However the staff at the club lounge is awesome and of great service!"
Memorable staycation,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"All the staff at Fullerton were very polite & friendly. We had a memorable belated birthday staycation for my mom. Our rooms were spacious & had a beautiful view of the Marina Bay. Special thanks to Claudia who helped accommodate to our staycation date changes, as I was sick .Shermaine from front desk also ensured check-in was smooth & efficient. Food was so-so , but wonderful service from the staff team at Town restaurant made our dining experience very pleasant . Keep up the good work !"
An experience like never before,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"Our experience had been the best starting from the check-in at reception desk to the room amenities, THE VIEW.... even the short 30 seconds exchange with the room service attendants were pleasant! Truly there's no negative feedback to give, can't even try to spot one. I do, however, wish that the hotel has a halal-certified restaurant or serves at least a halal-certified menu for in-room dining."
Perfect Staycation,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"2nd staycation at Fullerton and this time round, managed to book a room with Marina Bay view. The balcony was perfect, with table and chairs, for me to enjoy the view. The room was clean and conducive. Love that the TV comes with Chromecast and there was a Bluetooth speaker. Really enjoyed my stay and looking forward to future staycations with Fullerton!"
Quite a disappointment,Date of stay: March 2022,30,"Made a reservation with them for my boyfriend & I's 10 years anniversary celebration after reading all the good reviews posted by other couples.  1. Waited approx 1.5hour to check-in (check-in time was supposed to be 3PM, but the room was only ready at 4:16PM) -- we went to check with the receptionist at 4PM on the status of the room, and Tomoko kindly offered us to free drinks at their restaurant while waiting. 2. Checked into the room with another disappointment, as we couldn't see any anniversary amenities provided although they had agreed on email that it would be gladly arranged. After calling the receptionist, we received a very small slice of chocolate cake. Understand that anniversary amenities are complimentary, so we definitely appreciate the cake. However, after reading reviews/posts about the amenities offered to other couples, we couldn't help but to feel slightly disappointed.  I could see the staffs trying their best, and I am pleased with the service at the restaurant during the breakfast buffet too. Unfortunately though, this would probably be our last time here as we have definitely enjoyed better experience in other hotels (that are not 5-star hotels)."
Must try in rom dining!,Date of stay: March 2022,40,"I didn't expect in room dining so much. But it's so excellent! The potion is enough, and taste are great! You must try Pasta Napolitana and Caesar Salad, Humberger. If you are tired to go out to have dinner, you had better to try this in room dinning!"
Location Location Location,Date of stay: March 2022,40,Great for a short business or personal trip. Superb that this historic building has been restored and put to good use as a hotel in a great location. But rooms are average and ours had no view. But you should try this place at least once. Maybe back but will need better room.
Overnight staycation,Date of stay: March 2022,50,Second time staycation in Fullerton. Smaller room but cosy enough for one person staying. Nice and quite environment. Nice and friendly staff. Nice encounter from staff during breakfast. Always ensure all is ok. Overall a good night stay.
Ms,Date of stay: March 2022,40,"A good experience of staycation for my family. My daughters love it cause there is free ice cream for them daily. Location is good, convenient for dining outside the hotel. Nice view ad scenery for photo taking."

Great smiles and services by Rey and Wendy 🥰👍🏼,Date of stay: March 2022,30,"Must sincerely compliment the service of both Rey and Wendy. Though the food quality is not as good as expected, we were surprisely impressed by the friendly attitude and dedicated service by them. They constantly check in on us, refilling the wine etc and even help us feedback on the food quality to the chefs. However, the dining place seems to be more inclined towards the Caucasians, which made us feel out of place at the beginning, especially a server Princess. she cut our conversations a couple of times when we were chatting or ordering our food. This is very rude of her, the management ought to look into her professionalism as there are questions about her working attitude.  Thanks for the wonderful experience, Rey and Wendy! 💪🥰keep up with passion!"
Staycation,Date of stay: March 2022,50,Was there for staycation. The venue was accessible to most of the tourist attractions. Especially the museums. No issue to find food too. Like the old building myself as a local and have wanted to stay there at least once in my life.

"Beautiful hotel, nice pool",Date of stay: March 2022,40,"We enjoyed our stay at Fullerton. Room was clean and spacious though decor a little dated.

Gym was also well serviced with a vide variety of equipment in good condition."
Staycation,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"Very good selection of food and most importantly, superb service and warm hospitality. Manager Lalikumar served us very well and very attentive to our requests and needs. Very accomodating to our special request and we really enjoyed our stay"

Perfect staycation,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"I really enjoyed my stay at Fullerton, such beautiful hotel with steep history. The room is perfect and the pool scene at night is impressive. Excellent service from all staff and I receive a birthday cake though my birthday is 2 days ago. A pity I did not manage to go for the complimentary heritage tour as it is fully booked. Don’t to be miss is the beautiful display of the history of the building at the corridor leading to basement 2 towards the car park"
Classy as always,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"This is a well located excellent hotel. The service is great and hardly affected by Covid situation. The rooms are wonderful with comfortable beds, good bathrooms with excellent amenities. Wi-Fi and air conditioning work well. What more can you want? The food options are great ( sit outside on the veranda and enjoy). The only Covid downer is limited time pool side or in the gym. Will be back of course."
A very enjoyable trip,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"The hotel room is big enough for a rollaway bed to add it, yet still is very spacious. The hotel staff make alternative arrangement for us to go swimming at Fullerton Bayfront hotel when swimming facility at Fullerton is fully booked. The hotel is near the historical sites of Singapore and itself is an important site too."

"Great hotel, super staff.",Date of stay: March 2022,50,"What a super hotel. This was our first visit to Singapore - lots of complicated and constantly changing covid related requirements in order to enter Singapore but well worth it. Very welcoming, very comfortable and well positioned. Lovely food, but perhaps the most striking thing about this hotel is its staff- very friendly, helpful and competent. Booked a standard room, and were very happy. Air con nice & quiet, powerful shower, separate loo (always good), huge bath, and best of all, THE most comfortable bed we’ve ever experienced We will choose this hotel for our next visit here without a doubt. It is easy to get to most places from here and plenty of riverside eateries right on the doorstep. The breakfasts at The Fullerton are great - lovely choices, table service, and very pleasant environment. Plenty to keep us going until evening. There is absolutely nothing to fault. This team have got it off to a tee."
Staycation,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"Beautiful hotel with nostalgic vibes. Staff are ever pleasant and always willing to help. The spa is a must, it’s a great pampering. Breakfast is delicious and you could customise the items, they’re more than willing to adjust for you. Pillows were too soft for me though. Mattress is great! Will definitely come back."
Wonderful stay at the Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Date of stay: March 2022,50,Excellent service. Very thoughtful of the team to provide a birthday amenity. Hotel is convenient with parking and MRT. Hotel staff are all very friendly and approachable which makes the stay an extremely pleasant one.

A great staycation with kids.,Date of stay: March 2022,50,2 night stay at Fullerton. Excellent hospitality and kids loved it. Great to see many activities for kids. Room was very comfortable. Downside is very hard to get a swimming pool slot and in-room dining can be improved.
Amazing Hotel but leave the small kids home,Date of stay: March 2022,40,"The Fullerton hotel has amazing staff, facilities, and overall experience. However, my family and I soon realized it is not suitable really for a family staycation due to the lack of kid-oriented facilities.  That being said, the staff are super friendly towards the kids, and never once were we made to feel we didn't belong. Ultimately it was poor planning on our part, but I just wanted to share the experience for others looking to make similar choices.  Our kids are both under the age of 5."
Staycation,Date of stay: March 2022,50,Good value for money. High efficiency in arrival and departure with our request for extra bed. Hotel staff are willing to provide support upon request. Location is also highly accessible to great food outlets and cafes
None,Date of stay: March 2022,30,"It would hVe been better if there should be no judgement on guest with different type of booking to access to certain floors, as we are there, we should be able to access to all floors to have a look at the heritage hotel, this defeat the purpose of we are being denied access to those floors to find out more about the hotel. Pillow are too flat, it can be improved"
Amazing food and service,Date of stay: March 2022,50,Lalikumar and his team provided excellent service! We love our time here! Definitely try out the various teas. Food was amazing as well! We came for the afternoon tea session and enjoyed every bit of it!

Premium hotel that is part of Singapore's history,Date of stay: March 2022,40,"During check in process, we were ushered to be seated instead of standing in line. Water was served and when it was our turn, a staff approached us to attend to us.  Hotel was generally clean and well maintained.  We booked the Heritage room and it was huge. We got the room with a view of Cavenagh Bridge and Singapore River. Main bed was king size with good mattress and clean white sheets. Pillows were a bit too thin and soft. Extra bed was a pull-out sofa bed. Not the best comfort as the mattress was thin.  Location was perfect for day walks or night walks with plenty of nearby attractions to offer."
Staycay at Fullerton,Date of stay: March 2022,50,One night staycation for my boy's 7th. Was a pleasant experience. Checkin was very efficient. Room was clean and bedding was luxurious. room was comfortable enough for our family of 4. Toilet is huge with a nice bathtub.

It was nice to learn about the hotel history as we explored around and the ambience was very relaxing. Felt like a true holiday although still in SG.
Bounce back after lockdown,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"Great to see this hotel has survived Covid, and the necessary distancing does not detract from customer service. Breakfast was not the normal opulent level, and service in this area slower than I have experienced on previous stays."
Purple Afternoon Tea,Date of stay: March 2022,50,Excellent service from Fabian and John! Food was great as well and it made our dining experience so wonderful that i made another reservation to go again next week.  Thank you so much me and my bestie had enjoyed your afternoon tea.  See you again!

Fullerton Staycation,Date of stay: March 2022,40,"We stayed in a suite room and it was lovely. Fantastic view overlooking the ""fish belly"". Toilets are big and spacious.

Checking in by 5pm and they were really kind to extend late check out till 4pm. While waiting for our rooms to be ready the staff bring us to a holding area to have complementary ice cream and there was color material for kids. Overall staff were friendly and helpful, thanks Leena for the last min assistant for our accommodation and not forgetting on the 15th March a male Indian (forgotten his name) gentleman in the morning helping us to touch up our room."
3.5 for the staycation,Date of stay: March 2022,40,"Booked a 3 days 2 night staycation package via Klook. Overall experience was good but not fantastic. Made a booking of 3 rooms for families. The third room (my room) was not ready during check in around 2pm. Thought might just need to wait for an hour but to my disappointment, it was only ready at 5pm. (with me having to go down to check with the front desk twice). Nonetheless, I will like to compliment Warren and Gabriel (if i got his name correct) for assisting me with my check in.  Didn't manage to book a slot for the pool as the preferred slots are full. Not much activities going on in the hotel.  Kudos to Fabian and crew from Town Restaurant for their hospitality service. Service was prompt and very welcoming. Recommend the prata breakfast and laksa. It was the breakfast experience that deserved an additional 1 star."
Honeymoon staycation,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"Went for a staycation at Fullerton for our honeymoon. We had a very pleasant stay over at Fullerton. We liked everything about the room. Service was awesome from the moment we checked in. The view from our room was amazing! We also had a seamless check in and waiting time was quite short. Was greeted with a surprise gift to celebrate our honeymoon when we reach our room.Nurshamira greeted us with an awesome service. She was very helpful when attending to all our queries from the start, with patience. Nurshamira even went the extra mile to help us book slots to use the hotel's facilities on the spot. She and the courteous staffs of The Fullerton Hotel had made our stay even more memorable. Kudos!"

warm and cosy hotel,Date of stay: March 2022,30,"booked for march school holidays, but there isnt much activities for my son in the hotel, and also didnt manage to book the swimming pool. suggested to get booking of swimming pool and other facilities upon checking in... to avoid disappointment.

Good but could be better,Date of stay: March 2022,40,"Overall experience is good, room is good with Marina bay view (that I opted for). In-room dining and breakfast situation can be improved. No communication from hotel for pre-check in nor able to pre-book hotel facilities. The pool was only available for night slots by the time we checked in and this changed our plans for the day. Would be great if we could already pre-book and plan ahead."
Staycation converts,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"Service was wonderful right from the very beginning. To ensure that the check in process was smooth, we received a call to ask when we’d be arriving and we were also offered an upgrade. The room, we were told had not undergone a recent refurbishment that other rooms have had but on top of the room being several grades above the original booking we’d made, we’d be given an early check in. I was honestly a bit leery and worried having seen how tired hotel rooms could get. However, the promise of the view of the bay was too tempting and so we took the upgrade.  We were so impressed by how clean and well kept everything was. The towels were white and fluffy. We had a view of the bay and it was lovely to see the sunrise from the room. Soundproofing was amazing as we were just above the highway.  My 9 year old was given an ice cream pass with which he could redeem an ice cream from the restaurant daily! It really made the experience fun for him.  My husband tried the spa treatment which he said was great.  The pool was a tad small but offered great views.  The location of the hotel was fantastic and it was a great base for exploring the museums and attractions around. We were there for only 2 days and a night but we managed to pack a lot in as the location was so convenient.  We are planning our next stay already!"
Pleasant stay,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"Pillows are too soft for comfort. But overall it’s a pleasant stay. Room is spacious, front office staffs are friendly and helpful. Thank you for the thoughtful complimentary birthday cake for our girl."
'Amazing' Stay,Date of stay: March 2022,30,Flat pillows and no chamomile teas make our stay 'amazing'. Used SG Discovery vouchers so I can't complaint too much on it. Would have given 5-stars if not for those. But overall stay is nice as we really need re-charge due to covid making travelling quite hard.
Short staycay,Date of stay: March 2022,50,A wonderful staycay experience. All staff are polite and caring to your attentiveness. Their pancake was delicious in breakfast menu. Must try! So as their nasi lemak which is a great choice to pick too. Gym facilities are also well-equiped and new! Swimming pool is perfect for us too and not crowded especially at night. Good time to relax.
Staycation at the Fullerton Hotel,Date of stay: March 2022,50,"I decided to spend a night at the Fullerton Hotel as it was on my bucket list of things to do. This hotel is not new to me, I frequent the restaurants often. I would like to say the quality of the food at Fullerton is exquisite. I like the fragrant toiletteries and the room was very clean, they provide TWG tea in the room. I was very happy to get an upgrade so we ended up with a more spacious room, equipped with a heated toilet seat, with bidet and auto-lifting of the toilet seat - like those in Japan. This hotel is at the end of Boat Quay, in the civic district area and very near to many attractions, Marina Bay and Clifford Pier. It is very well located. Hoping to have another chance to stay there."

Fabulous Hotel - Disappointing Casual Dining,Date of stay: March 2022,40,"Hotel, Room & Staff all outstanding. We dined at Jade which was a magical experience. Extremely disappointed with Coffee & Cake in the Lobby - $52.00 for two very small slices of cake and two flat whites - absolute robbery. Upon returning to the hotel after a night out we asked for two cans of soft drink and was told $25.00 - we declined. I would love to spend more money at the hotel restaurants if the pricing wasn't so ridiculous."
Staycay using SRV,Date of stay: March 2022,40,"I stayed in the premier courtyard room. I was told it was newly renovated. Nothing really special about the room itself. But I like the toilet functions. There is a front and back bidet and even a blow-dry function. And the lid will auto raised when you enter. It feels like you are being welcome. It will closed back once you leave. The toilet seat is also heated, so it's warm. There are no halal food options, so I have to get my food elsewhere. But it's not difficult to find halal food nearby."
Staycation!,Date of stay: March 2022,40,Bed was rock hard. Breakfast was forgettable. Everything else was impeccable from check in all the way to check out. Location was good for Merlion and those strolls by the Bayfront. If you are lucky you would even get a room with a view of the Bayfront.

Cons Room was very dusty, ordered housekeeping, but still came back to a dusty room. I had allergic reaction throughout my stay.  Not much halal food options. Would be good if one of the restaurants is halal certified."
Marina Bay View Room,Date of stay: March 2022,40,"It was a 3D2N staycation with my partner. Paid slightly more to get the Marina Bay View Room, and it was totally worth it.  Amenities wise like the gym and pool, it's a little small but sufficient enough to enjoy some time. Only had issues with the bedding, the pillows were so thin it lack cushion & support for the neck, literally felt like I wasn't lying on anything. I woke up having some stiff neck. The quilt was very thin as well, it felt like a piece of cloth."

"Best in class, but concierge staff a little bit patronising",Date of stay: February 2022,40,"I had a relatively pleasant 4-nights stay at the Fullerton Hotel. The balcony was very unique and the amenities in the hotel was great.  However, we didn’t feel very welcomed especially at the start of the stay because the concierge staff were very unwelcoming right off the bat. Once, while making my way to the reception, a concierge staff walked really fast towards me and asked “are you a guest here?” in the most patronising tone I’ve seen from a service staff. This kept on repeating for me throughout my stay and I kept having to show them my key cards for some reason?  I can safely say that most guests didn’t receive the same treatment as I did so I’m really curious as to why I was treated in such a way."
Awesome Stay,Date of stay: February 2022,50,"We have taken the Valentine promo for a couple friend for a mini honeymoon treat and Fullerton just made it all possible, nothing more we can ask for- all delivered as expected and more!

We had our afternoon tea at the Courtyard Restaurant & were served by your professional staff Mr. Fabian. He explained everything about the tea, sandwiches and pastries that he served us! All your staff are an assets! The room is clean and well maintained! Room assigned to us has the best view! Overall, it’s worth every penny! It’s the service that will make us return back again.

On arriving we were told that each room had only 1 hr. allocation to the pool & that hour had to be booked. Room service would be delivered to the door & all drinks served in plastic cups. The Breakfast was not only terribly limited but had been sitting in bae marries for what seemed hours. The scrambled eggs dry & the coffee cold. Annie at reception was the only saving grace in what was a terrible & expensive experience We stayed 1 night and went to Capella, what a difference."

We had stayed at Fullerton Bay at the start of the trip and stayed here at the end to experience both hotels. We preferred Fullerton to Fullerton Bay. The building is beautiful and was beautifully decorated for Chines new year. The staff were excellent especially the ladies in Straits Club. A special mention for Siti and the lovely lady who was half French, sorry I forgot her name. We had a Straits club room overlooking marina bay. Very comfortable room. Good bathroom. The room was kept very clean however a negative was the balcony was never cleaned and the leaves built up so every time you went outside you had leaves stuck to your feet. As it did rain a few times the balcony was also wet as it never really dried. The room could have done with a comfortable arm chair as there was nowhere to sit to relax apart from the bed or a hard chair by the desk. Nice swimming pool area but the pool was too cold. Much preferred the pool at Fullerton Bay. The food in Straits club was first class from breakfast to afternoon tea then canapés. I have deducted a point from the rating due to what happened after check out and this has left a bad taste with us and certainly will make us rethink about returning to this hotel. After checking out we had 90 mins to wait for taxi to airport. We decided to chill out and have a last drink and as it was happy hour even better. However we were very surprised to be told they were fully booked and we could not be served. On walking outside we noticed the outside bar area had very few tables taken. Went back and spoke to a receptionist who went to ask on our behalf to be told they were fully booked. I have never had such service in a 5 star hotel and we stay in many all over the world. I find it unbelievable that you refuse to serve guests a drink after spending 6 days with you. In fact the receptionist went on we could go to a nearby Starbucks and buy a takeaway drink and bring it back to sit in hotel lobby. Why should we have to walk to somewhere else to get a drink and as we wanted a cocktail Starbucks would not have what we wanted. We could have walked to Boat Quay but it looked like rain and as we had a 14 hour flight ahead of us we did not want to risk the chance of getting soaked. We cannot understand if the bar was full which it certainly was not why could a waiter not be sent to take our order in the empty lobby and bring us drinks. Not 5 star service at all, very disappointing."
Pleasant and relaxing staycation,Date of stay: February 2022,50,Thoroughly enjoyed a short weekend break at the Fullerton Hotel. All staff were friendly and accommodating and made our stay a pleasant one. We were given a room overlooking the Singapore River with a great view. The room was spacious and comfortable and the hotel facilities did not disappoint. Five star experience!
Very Lovely Get-away with Loved Ones,Date of stay: January 2022,50,Enjoyed my time with Fullerton Hotel. I've stayed with Fullerton for a number of occasions already and the service and quality of each stay have been nothing but great experience. Keep up the good job! Cheers!
Perfect stay as always,Date of stay: February 2022,50,"Incredible stay with Fullerton Singapore. Great service, great room and great views. Just a perfect staycation.  Stayed in a high-floor quay-side room.The rooms may differ in-size due to the unique shape of Fullerton but each room I have been in so far has just been wonderfully comfortable and not too small. Beds were medium firm-ness and pillows plush. Cleanliness was top-notch which is just what you would want whether during a pandemic or not. One thing I cannot stress enough is the level of service the staff display, there are several occasions in which I would say the went beyond their call of duty."
Pleasant Stay (Sans the car park),Date of stay: February 2022,40,"rather pleasant stay and location near MBS and Merlion park is good. however, the car park is a big issue as the lifts are always not working. if you don't drive that is fine, but otherwise it is very frustrating especially with family with baby or young kids where you would have to climb stairs with all the baby stuffs (diaper bags and strollers etc) and the baby! imagine now during checking in and out with all the luggages too. nightmare!"
Staycation,Date of stay: February 2022,50,We are very pleased with the service of the staffs and the ambience of the hotel.  The staffs at the front desk were very proactive. The staffs at the restaurants were very helpful too. The receptionists were also very helpful and patient.
